<h2><a name="AV1_PREFACE" id="AV1_PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> public are here presented with
the last literary attempt of an author,
whose fame has been uncommonly extensive,
and whose talents have probably
been most admired, by the persons
by whom talents are estimated
with the greatest accuracy and discrimination.
There are few, to whom
her writings could in any case have<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-viii" id="APg_1-viii"></a>[<a href="images/v1-viii.png">viii</a>]</span>
given pleasure, that would have wished
that this fragment should have been
suppressed, because it is a fragment.
There is a sentiment, very dear to minds
of taste and imagination, that finds a
melancholy delight in contemplating
these unfinished productions of genius,
these sketches of what, if they had
been filled up in a manner adequate to
the writer's conception, would perhaps
have given a new impulse to the
manners of a world.</p>

<p>The purpose and structure of the
following work, had long formed a
favourite subject of meditation with
its author, and she judged them capable
of producing an important effect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-ix" id="APg_1-ix"></a>[<a href="images/v1-ix.png">ix</a>]</span>
The composition had been in progress
for a period of twelve months. She
was anxious to do justice to her conception,
and recommenced and revised
the manuscript several different times.
So much of it as is here given to the
public, she was far from considering
as finished, and, in a letter to a friend
directly written on this subject, she
says, "I am perfectly aware that some of
the incidents ought to be transposed,
and heightened by more harmonious
shading; and I wished in some degree
to avail myself of criticism, before I
began to adjust my events into a story,
the outline of which I had sketched in<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-x" id="APg_1-x"></a>[<a href="images/v1-x.png">x</a>]</span>
my mind<a name="AFNanchor_X-A_1" id="AFNanchor_X-A_1"></a><a href="#AFootnote_X-A_1" class="fnanchor">[x-A]</a>." The only friends to whom
the author communicated her manuscript,
were Mr. Dyson, the translator
of the Sorcerer, and the present editor;
and it was impossible for the most inexperienced
author to display a stronger
desire of profiting by the censures and
sentiments that might be suggested<a name="AFNanchor_X-B_2" id="AFNanchor_X-B_2"></a><a href="#AFootnote_X-B_2" class="fnanchor">[x-B]</a>.</p>

<p>In revising these sheets for the press,
it was necessary for the editor, in some
places, to connect the more finished<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-xi" id="APg_1-xi"></a>[<a href="images/v1-xi.png">xi</a>]</span>
parts with the pages of an older copy,
and a line or two in addition sometimes
appeared requisite for that purpose.
Wherever such a liberty has been
taken, the additional phrases will be
found inclosed in brackets; it being
the editor's most earnest desire, to
intrude nothing of himself into the
work, but to give to the public the
words, as well as ideas, of the real
author.</p>

<p>What follows in the ensuing pages,
is not a preface regularly drawn out
by the author, but merely hints for a
preface, which, though never filled up
in the manner the writer intended,
appeared to be worth preserving.</p>

<h2><a name="AAUTHORs_PREFACE" id="AAUTHORs_PREFACE"></a><span class="smcap">AUTHOR's PREFACE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Wrongs of Woman, like the
wrongs of the oppressed part of mankind,
may be deemed necessary by
their oppressors: but surely there are
a few, who will dare to advance before
the improvement of the age, and
grant that my sketches are not the
abortion of a distempered fancy, or
the strong delineations of a wounded
heart.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-xiv" id="APg_1-xiv"></a>[<a href="images/v1-xiv.png">xiv</a>]</span>In writing this novel, I have rather
endeavoured to pourtray passions than
manners.</p>

<p>In many instances I could have made
the incidents more dramatic, would I
have sacrificed my main object, the
desire of exhibiting the misery and
oppression, peculiar to women, that
arise out of the partial laws and customs
of society.</p>

<p>In the invention of the story, this
view restrained my fancy; and the
history ought rather to be considered,
as of woman, than of an individual.</p>

<p>The sentiments I have embodied.</p>

<p>In many works of this species, the
hero is allowed to be mortal, and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-xv" id="APg_1-xv"></a>[<a href="images/v1-xv.png">xv</a>]</span>
become wise and virtuous as well as
happy, by a train of events and circumstances.
The heroines, on the
contrary, are to be born immaculate;
and to act like goddesses of wisdom, just
come forth highly finished Minervas
from the head of Jove.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>[The following is an extract of a
letter from the author to a friend, to
whom she communicated her manuscript.]</p>

<hr />

<p>For my part, I cannot suppose any
situation more distressing, than for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-xvi" id="APg_1-xvi"></a>[<a href="images/v1-xvi.png">xvi</a>]</span>
woman of sensibility, with an improving
mind, to be bound to such a man
as I have described for life; obliged
to renounce all the humanizing affections,
and to avoid cultivating her
taste, lest her perception of grace and
refinement of sentiment, should sharpen
to agony the pangs of disappointment.
Love, in which the imagination
mingles its bewitching colouring,
must be fostered by delicacy. I should
despise, or rather call her an ordinary
woman, who could endure such a husband
as I have sketched.</p>

<p>These appear to me (matrimonial
despotism of heart and conduct) to be
the peculiar Wrongs of Woman, be<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-xvii" id="APg_1-xvii"></a>[<a href="images/v1-xvii.png">xvii</a>]</span>cause
they degrade the mind. What
are termed great misfortunes, may
more forcibly impress the mind of common
readers; they have more of what
may justly be termed <i>stage-effect</i>; but
it is the delineation of finer sensations,
which, in my opinion, constitutes the
merit of our best novels. This is what
I have in view; and to show the
wrongs of different classes of women,
equally oppressive, though, from the
difference of education, necessarily
various.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a name="ACHAP_I" id="ACHAP_I"></a>CHAP. I.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Abodes</span> of horror have frequently
been described, and castles, filled with
spectres and chimeras, conjured up by
the magic spell of genius to harrow the
soul, and absorb the wondering mind.
But, formed of such stuff as dreams are
made of, what were they to the mansion
of despair, in one corner of which
Maria sat, endeavouring to recal her
scattered thoughts!</p>

<p>Surprise, astonishment, that bordered
on distraction, seemed to have suspend<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-2" id="APg_1-2"></a>[<a href="images/v1-2.png">2</a>]</span>ed
her faculties, till, waking by degrees
to a keen sense of anguish, a
whirlwind of rage and indignation
roused her torpid pulse. One recollection
with frightful velocity following
another, threatened to fire her brain,
and make her a fit companion for the
terrific inhabitants, whose groans and
shrieks were no unsubstantial sounds of
whistling winds, or startled birds, modulated
by a romantic fancy, which
amuse while they affright; but such
tones of misery as carry a dreadful certainty
directly to the heart. What
effect must they then have produced on
one, true to the touch of sympathy, and
tortured by maternal apprehension<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '.!'">!</ins></p>

<p>Her infant's image was continually
floating on Maria's sight, and the first
smile of intelligence remembered, as
none but a mother, an unhappy mo<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-3" id="APg_1-3"></a>[<a href="images/v1-3.png">3</a>]</span>ther,
can conceive. She heard her half
<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Errata: original reads 'speaking half'">speaking</ins> cooing, and felt the little
twinkling fingers on her burning bosom&mdash;a
bosom bursting with the nutriment
for which this cherished child
might now be pining in vain. From
a stranger she could indeed receive the
maternal aliment, Maria was grieved
at the thought&mdash;but who would watch
her with a mother's tenderness, a mother's
self-denial?</p>

<p>The retreating shadows of former
sorrows rushed back in a gloomy train,
and seemed to be pictured on the walls
of her prison, magnified by the state
of mind in which they were viewed&mdash;Still
she mourned for her child, lamented
she was a daughter, and anticipated
the aggravated ills of life that her sex
rendered almost inevitable, even while
dreading she was no more. To think<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-4" id="APg_1-4"></a>[<a href="images/v1-4.png">4</a>]</span>
that she was blotted out of existence
was agony, when the imagination had
been long employed to expand her
faculties; yet to suppose her turned
adrift on an unknown sea, was scarcely
less afflicting.</p>

<p>After being two days the prey of impetuous,
varying emotions, Maria began
to reflect more calmly on her present
situation, for she had actually been rendered
incapable of sober reflection, by
the discovery of the act of atrocity of
which she was the victim. She could
not have imagined, that, in all the fermentation
of civilized depravity, a similar
plot could have entered a human
mind. She had been stunned by an unexpected
blow; yet life, however joyless,
was not to be indolently resigned,
or misery endured without exertion,
and proudly termed patience. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-5" id="APg_1-5"></a>[<a href="images/v1-5.png">5</a>]</span>
had hitherto meditated only to point
the dart of anguish, and suppressed
the heart heavings of indignant nature
merely by the force of contempt. Now
she endeavoured to brace her mind to
fortitude, and to ask herself what was
to be her employment in her dreary
cell? Was it not to effect her escape,
to fly to the succour of her child, and
to baffle the selfish schemes of her tyrant&mdash;her
husband?</p>

<p>These thoughts roused her sleeping
spirit, and the self-possession returned,
that seemed to have abandoned her in
the infernal solitude into which she
had been precipitated. The first emotions
of overwhelming impatience began
to subside, and resentment gave
place to tenderness, and more tranquil
meditation; though anger once more
stopt the calm current of reflection<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '.'">,</ins><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-6" id="APg_1-6"></a>[<a href="images/v1-6.png">6</a>]</span>
when she attempted to move her manacled
arms. But this was an outrage
that could only excite momentary feelings
of scorn, which evaporated in a
faint smile; for Maria was far from
thinking a personal insult the most difficult
to endure with magnanimous indifference.</p>

<p>She approached the small grated
window of her chamber, and for a
considerable time only regarded the
blue expanse; though it commanded
a view of a desolate garden, and of
part of a huge pile of buildings, that,
after having been suffered, for half a
century, to fall to decay, had undergone
some clumsy repairs, merely to
render it habitable. The ivy had been
torn off the turrets, and the stones not
wanted to patch up the breaches of
time, and exclude the warring ele<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-7" id="APg_1-7"></a>[<a href="images/v1-7.png">7</a>]</span>ments,
left in heaps in the disordered
court. Maria contemplated this scene
she knew not how long; or rather
gazed on the walls, and pondered on
her situation. To the master of this
most horrid of prisons, she had, soon
after her entrance, raved of injustice,
in accents that would have justified
his treatment, had not a malignant
smile, when she appealed to his judgment,
with a dreadful conviction stifled
her remonstrating complaints. By
force, or openly, what could be done?
But surely some expedient might occur
to an active mind, without any other
employment, and possessed of sufficient
resolution to put the risk of life into
the balance with the chance of freedom.</p>

<p>A woman entered in the midst of
these reflections, with a firm, deliberate<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-8" id="APg_1-8"></a>[<a href="images/v1-8.png">8</a>]</span>
step, strongly marked features, and
large black eyes, which she fixed
steadily on Maria's, as if she designed
to intimidate her, saying at the same
time&mdash;"You had better sit down and
eat your dinner, than look at the
clouds."</p>

<p>"I have no appetite," replied Maria,
who had previously determined to
speak mildly, "why then should I
eat?"</p>

<p>"But, in spite of that, you must
and shall eat something. I have had
many ladies under my care, who have
resolved to starve themselves; but, soon
or late, they gave up their intent, as
they recovered their senses."</p>

<p>"Do you really think me mad?"
asked Maria, meeting the searching
glance of her eye.</p>

<p>"Not just now. But what does<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-9" id="APg_1-9"></a>[<a href="images/v1-9.png">9</a>]</span>
that prove?&mdash;only that you must be
the more carefully watched, for appearing
at times so reasonable. You
have not touched a morsel since you
entered the house."&mdash;Maria sighed intelligibly.&mdash;"Could
any thing but madness
produce such a disgust for food?"</p>

<p>"Yes, grief; you would not ask
the question if you knew what it
was." The attendant shook her head;
and a ghastly smile of desperate fortitude
served as a forcible reply, and
made Maria pause, before she added&mdash;"Yet
I will take some refreshment:
I mean not to die.&mdash;No; I will preserve
my senses; and convince even
you, sooner than you are aware of,
that my intellects have never been disturbed,
though the exertion of them
may have been suspended by some infernal
drug."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-10" id="APg_1-10"></a>[<a href="images/v1-10.png">10</a>]</span>
Doubt gathered still thicker on the
brow of her guard, as she attempted
to convict her of mistake.</p>

<p>"Have patience!" exclaimed Maria,
with a solemnity that inspired awe.
"My God! how have I been schooled
into the practice!" A suffocation of
voice betrayed the agonizing emotions
she was labouring to keep down; and
conquering a qualm of disgust, she
calmly endeavoured to eat enough to
prove her docility, perpetually turning
to the suspicious female, whose observation
she courted, while she was
making the bed and adjusting the
room.</p>

<p>"Come to me often," said Maria,
with a tone of persuasion, in consequence
of a vague plan that she had
hastily adopted, when, after surveying
this woman's form and features, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-11" id="APg_1-11"></a>[<a href="images/v1-11.png">11</a>]</span>
felt convinced that she had an understanding
above the common standard;
"and believe me mad, till you are
obliged to acknowledge the contrary."
The woman was no fool, that is, she
was superior to her class; nor had
misery quite petrified the life's-blood
of humanity, to which reflections on
our own misfortunes only give a more
orderly course. The manner, rather
than the expostulations, of Maria
made a slight suspicion dart into her
mind with corresponding sympathy,
which various other avocations, and
the habit of banishing compunction,
prevented her, for the present, from
examining more minutely.</p>

<p>But when she was told that no person,
excepting the physician appointed by
her family, was to be permitted to see
the lady at the end of the gallery, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-12" id="APg_1-12"></a>[<a href="images/v1-12.png">12</a>]</span>
opened her keen eyes still wider, and
uttered a&mdash;"hem!" before she enquired&mdash;"Why?"
She was briefly told, in
reply, that the malady was hereditary,
and the fits not occurring but at very
long and irregular intervals, she must
be carefully watched; for the length of
these lucid periods only rendered her
more mischievous, when any vexation
or caprice brought on the paroxysm of
phrensy.</p>

<p>Had her master trusted her, it is
probable that neither pity nor curiosity
would have made her swerve from the
straight line of her interest; for she
had suffered too much in her intercourse
with mankind, not to determine
to look for support, rather to humouring
their passions, than courting
their approbation by the integrity of
her conduct. A deadly blight had met<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-13" id="APg_1-13"></a>[<a href="images/v1-13.png">13</a>]</span>
her at the very threshold of existence;
and the wretchedness of her mother
seemed a heavy weight fastened on her
innocent neck, to drag her down to
perdition. She could not heroically
determine to succour an unfortunate;
but, offended at the bare supposition
that she could be deceived with the
same ease as a common servant, she
no longer curbed her curiosity; and,
though she never seriously fathomed
her own intentions, she would sit, every
moment she could steal from observation,
listening to the tale, which Maria
was eager to relate with all the persuasive
eloquence of grief.</p>

<p>It is so cheering to see a human
face, even if little of the divinity of
virtue beam in it, that Maria anxiously
expected the return of the attendant,
as of a gleam of light to break the<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-14" id="APg_1-14"></a>[<a href="images/v1-14.png">14</a>]</span>
gloom of idleness. Indulged sorrow;
she perceived, must blunt or sharpen
the faculties to the two opposite extremes;
producing stupidity, the moping
melancholy of indolence; or the
restless activity of a disturbed imagination.
She sunk into one state, after
being fatigued by the other: till the
want of occupation became even more
painful than the actual pressure or apprehension
of sorrow; and the confinement
that froze her into a nook of
existence, with an unvaried prospect
before her, the most insupportable of
evils. The lamp of life seemed to be
spending itself to chase the vapours of
a dungeon which no art could dissipate.&mdash;And
to what purpose did she
rally all her energy?&mdash;Was not the
world a vast prison, and women born
slaves?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-15" id="APg_1-15"></a>[<a href="images/v1-15.png">15</a>]</span>
Though she failed immediately to
rouse a lively sense of injustice in the
mind of her guard, because it had
been sophisticated into misanthropy,
she touched her heart. Jemima (she
had only a claim to a Christian name,
which had not procured her any Christian
privileges) could patiently hear of
Maria's confinement on false pretences;
she had felt the crushing hand of
power, hardened by the exercise of
injustice, and ceased to wonder at the
perversions of the understanding, which
systematize oppression; but, when told
that her child, only four months old,
had been torn from her, even while
she was discharging the tenderest maternal
office, the woman awoke in a
bosom long estranged from feminine
emotions, and Jemima determined to
alleviate all in her power, without ha<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-16" id="APg_1-16"></a>[<a href="images/v1-16.png">16</a>]</span>zarding
the loss of her place, the sufferings
of a wretched mother, apparently
injured, and certainly unhappy.
A sense of right seems to result from
the simplest act of reason, and to preside
over the faculties of the mind,
like the master-sense of feeling, to
rectify the rest; but (for the comparison
may be carried still farther) how
often is the exquisite sensibility of
both weakened or destroyed by the
vulgar occupations, and ignoble pleasures
of life?</p>

<p>The preserving her situation was,
indeed, an important object to Jemima,
who had been hunted from hole
to hole, as if she had been a beast of
prey, or infected with a moral plague.
The wages she received, the greater
part of which she hoarded, as her only
chance for independence, were much<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-17" id="APg_1-17"></a>[<a href="images/v1-17.png">17</a>]</span>
more considerable than she could reckon
on obtaining any where else, were
it possible that she, an outcast from
society, could be permitted to earn a
subsistence in a reputable family. Hearing
Maria perpetually complain of listlessness,
and the not being able to beguile
grief by resuming her customary
pursuits, she was easily prevailed on,
by compassion, and that involuntary
respect for abilities, which those who
possess them can never eradicate, to
bring her some books and implements
for writing. Maria's conversation had
amused and interested her, and the natural
consequence was a desire, scarcely
observed by herself, of obtaining the
esteem of a person she admired. The
remembrance of better days was rendered
more lively; and the sentiments
then acquired appearing less romantic<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-18" id="APg_1-18"></a>[<a href="images/v1-18.png">18</a>]</span>
than they had for a long period, a
spark of hope roused her mind to new
activity.</p>

<p>How grateful was her attention to
Maria! Oppressed by a dead weight
of existence, or preyed on by the
gnawing worm of discontent, with
what eagerness did she endeavour to
shorten the long days, which left no
traces behind! She seemed to be
sailing on the vast ocean of life, without
seeing any land-mark to indicate
the progress of time; to find employment
was then to find variety, the
animating principle of nature.</p>

<h2><a name="ACHAP_II" id="ACHAP_II"></a>CHAP. II.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Earnestly</span> as Maria endeavoured
to soothe, by reading, the anguish
of her wounded mind, her thoughts
would often wander from the subject
she was led to discuss, and tears of
maternal tenderness obscured the reasoning
page. She descanted on "the
ills which flesh is heir to," with bitterness,
when the recollection of her
babe was revived by a tale of fictitious
woe, that bore any resemblance to her
own; and her imagination was continually
employed, to conjure up and
embody the various phantoms of misery,
which folly and vice had let loose
on the world. The loss of her babe
was the tender string; against other
cruel remembrances she laboured to<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-20" id="APg_1-20"></a>[<a href="images/v1-20.png">20</a>]</span>
steel her bosom; and even a ray of
hope, in the midst of her gloomy reveries,
would sometimes gleam on the
dark horizon of futurity, while persuading
herself that she ought to cease
to hope, since happiness was no where
to be found.&mdash;But of her child, debilitated
by the grief with which its
mother had been assailed before it saw
the light, she could not think without
an impatient struggle.</p>

<p>"I, alone, by my active tenderness,
could have saved," she would exclaim,
"from an early blight, this sweet
blossom; and, cherishing it, I should
have had something still to love."</p>

<p>In proportion as other expectations
were torn from her, this tender one
had been fondly clung to, and knit
into her heart.</p>

<p>The books she had obtained, were<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-21" id="APg_1-21"></a>[<a href="images/v1-21.png">21</a>]</span>
soon devoured, by one who had no
other resource to escape from sorrow,
and the feverish dreams of ideal wretchedness
or felicity, which equally weaken
the intoxicated sensibility. Writing
was then the only alternative, and
she wrote some rhapsodies descriptive
of the state of her mind; but the
events of her past life pressing on her,
she resolved circumstantially to relate
them, with the sentiments that experience,
and more matured reason,
would naturally suggest. They might
perhaps instruct her daughter, and
shield her from the misery, the tyranny,
her mother knew not how to avoid.</p>

<p>This thought gave life to her diction,
her soul flowed into it, and she soon
found the task of recollecting almost
obliterated impressions very interesting.
She lived again in the revived emo<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-22" id="APg_1-22"></a>[<a href="images/v1-22.png">22</a>]</span>tions
of youth, and forgot her present
in the retrospect of sorrows that had
assumed an unalterable character.</p>

<p>Though this employment lightened
the weight of time, yet, never losing
sight of her main object, Maria did
not allow any opportunity to slip of
winning on the affections of Jemima;
for she discovered in her a strength of
mind, that excited her esteem, clouded
as it was by the misanthropy of despair.</p>

<p>An insulated being, from the misfortune
of her birth, she despised and
preyed on the society by which she
had been oppressed, and loved not her
fellow-creatures, because she had never
been beloved. No mother had ever
fondled her, no father or brother had
protected her from outrage; and the
man who had plunged her into in<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-23" id="APg_1-23"></a>[<a href="images/v1-23.png">23</a>]</span>famy,
and deserted her when she stood
in greatest need of support, deigned
not to smooth with kindness the road
to ruin. Thus degraded, was she let
loose on the world; and virtue, never
nurtured by affection, assumed the stern
aspect of selfish independence.</p>

<p>This general view of her life, Maria
gathered from her exclamations and
dry remarks. Jemima indeed displayed
a strange mixture of interest
and suspicion; for she would listen to
her with earnestness, and then suddenly
interrupt the conversation, as if
afraid of resigning, by giving way to
her sympathy, her dear-bought knowledge
of the world.</p>

<p>Maria alluded to the possibility of
an escape, and mentioned a compensation,
or reward; but the style in which
she was repulsed made her cautious,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-24" id="APg_1-24"></a>[<a href="images/v1-24.png">24</a>]</span>
and determine not to renew the subject,
till she knew more of the character
she had to work on. Jemima's
countenance, and dark hints, seemed
to say, "You are an extraordinary
woman; but let me consider, this may
only be one of your lucid intervals."
Nay, the very energy of Maria's character,
made her suspect that the extraordinary
animation she perceived
might be the effect of madness. "Should
her husband then substantiate his
charge, and get possession of her estate,
from whence would come the promised
annuity, or more desired protection?
Besides, might not a woman, anxious
to escape, conceal some of the circumstances
which made against her? Was
truth to be expected from one who
had been entrapped, kidnapped, in
the most fraudulent manner?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-25" id="APg_1-25"></a>[<a href="images/v1-25.png">25</a>]</span>
In this train Jemima continued to
argue, the moment after compassion
and respect seemed to make her swerve;
and she still resolved not to be wrought
on to do more than soften the rigour
of confinement, till she could advance
on surer ground.</p>

<p>Maria was not permitted to walk in
the garden; but sometimes, from her
window, she turned her eyes from the
gloomy walls, in which she pined life
away, on the poor wretches who strayed
along the walks, and contemplated
the most terrific of ruins&mdash;that of a
human soul. What is the view of the
fallen column, the mouldering arch, of
the most exquisite workmanship, when
compared with this living memento of
the fragility, the instability, of reason,
and the wild luxuriancy of noxious
passions? Enthusiasm turned adrift,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-26" id="APg_1-26"></a>[<a href="images/v1-26.png">26</a>]</span>
like some rich stream overflowing its
banks, rushes forward with destructive
velocity, inspiring a sublime concentration
of thought. Thus thought
Maria&mdash;These are the ravages over
which humanity must ever mournfully
ponder, with a degree of anguish not
excited by crumbling marble, or cankering
brass, unfaithful to the trust of
monumental fame. It is not over the
decaying productions of the mind, embodied
with the happiest art, we grieve
most bitterly. The view of what has
been done by man, produces a melancholy,
yet aggrandizing, sense of what
remains to be achieved by human intellect;
but a mental convulsion, which,
like the devastation of an earthquake,
throws all the elements of thought and
imagination into confusion, makes con<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-27" id="APg_1-27"></a>[<a href="images/v1-27.png">27</a>]</span>templation
giddy, and we fearfully ask
on what ground we ourselves stand.</p>

<p>Melancholy and imbecility marked
the features of the wretches allowed to
breathe at large; for the frantic, those
who in a strong imagination had lost a
sense of woe, were closely confined.
The playful tricks and mischievous devices
of their disturbed fancy, that suddenly
broke out, could not be guarded
against, when they were permitted to
enjoy any portion of freedom; for,
so active was their imagination, that
every new object which accidentally
struck their senses, awoke to phrenzy
their restless passions; as Maria learned
from the burden of their incessant
ravings.</p>

<p>Sometimes, with a strict injunction
of silence, Jemima would allow Maria,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-28" id="APg_1-28"></a>[<a href="images/v1-28.png">28</a>]</span>
at the close of evening, to stray along
the narrow avenues that separated the
dungeon-like apartments, leaning on
her arm. What a change of scene!
Maria wished to pass the threshold of
her prison, yet, when by chance she
met the eye of rage glaring on her, yet
unfaithful to its office, she shrunk back
with more horror and affright, than if
she had stumbled over a mangled corpse.
Her busy fancy pictured the misery of a
fond heart, watching over a friend thus
estranged, absent, though present&mdash;over
a poor wretch lost to reason and the
social joys of existence; and losing all
consciousness of misery in its excess.
What a task, to watch the light of reason
quivering in the eye, or with agonizing
expectation to catch the beam of recollection;
tantalized by hope, only to
feel despair more keenly, at finding a<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-29" id="APg_1-29"></a>[<a href="images/v1-29.png">29</a>]</span>
much loved face or voice, suddenly remembered,
or pathetically implored,
only to be immediately forgotten, or
viewed with indifference or abhorrence!</p>

<p>The heart-rending sigh of melancholy
sunk into her soul; and when she retired
to rest, the petrified figures she
had encountered, the only human forms
she was doomed to observe, haunting
her dreams with tales of mysterious
wrongs, made her wish to sleep to dream
no more.</p>

<p>Day after day rolled away, and tedious
as the present moment appeared,
they passed in such an unvaried tenor,
Maria was surprised to find that she
had already been six weeks buried alive,
and yet had such faint hopes of effecting
her enlargement. She was, earnestly
as she had sought for employment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-30" id="APg_1-30"></a>[<a href="images/v1-30.png">30</a>]</span>
now angry with herself for having been
amused by writing her narrative; and
grieved to think that she had for an instant
thought of any thing, but contriving
to escape.</p>

<p>Jemima had evidently pleasure in
her society: still, though she often left
her with a glow of kindness, she returned
with the same chilling air; and,
when her heart appeared for a moment
to open, some suggestion of reason forcibly
closed it, before she could give
utterance to the confidence Maria's
conversation inspired.</p>

<p>Discouraged by these changes, Maria
relapsed into despondency, when she
was cheered by the alacrity with which
Jemima brought her a fresh parcel of
books; assuring her, that she had taken
some pains to obtain them from one of
the keepers, who attended a gentle<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-31" id="APg_1-31"></a>[<a href="images/v1-31.png">31</a>]</span>man
confined in the opposite corner of
the gallery.</p>

<p>Maria took up the books with emotion.
"They come," said she, "perhaps,
from a wretch condemned, like
me, to reason on the nature of madness,
by having wrecked minds continually
under his eye; and almost to wish himself&mdash;as
I do&mdash;mad, to escape from the
contemplation of it." Her heart throbbed
with sympathetic alarm; and she
turned over the leaves with awe, as if
they had become sacred from passing
through the hands of an unfortunate
being, oppressed by a similar fate.</p>

<p>Dryden's Fables, Milton's Paradise
Lost, with several modern productions,
composed the collection. It was a
mine of treasure. Some marginal notes,
in Dryden's Fables, caught her attention:
they were written with force<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-32" id="APg_1-32"></a>[<a href="images/v1-32.png">32</a>]</span>
and taste; and, in one of the modern
pamphlets, there was a fragment left,
containing various observations on the
present state of society and government,
with a comparative view of the
politics of Europe and America. These
remarks were written with a degree of
generous warmth, when alluding to the
enslaved state of the labouring majority,
perfectly in unison with Maria's mode
of thinking.</p>

<p>She read them over and over again;
and fancy, treacherous fancy, began to
sketch a character, congenial with her
own, from these shadowy outlines.&mdash;"Was
he mad?" She re-perused the
marginal notes, and they seemed the
production of an animated, but not of a
disturbed imagination. Confined to
this speculation, every time she re-read
them, some fresh refinement of<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-33" id="APg_1-33"></a>[<a href="images/v1-33.png">33</a>]</span>
sentiment, or <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'accuteness'">acuteness</ins> of thought
impressed her, which she was astonished
at herself for not having before observed.</p>

<p>What a creative power has an affectionate
heart! There are beings who
cannot live without loving, as poets
love; and who feel the electric spark
of genius, wherever it awakens sentiment
or grace. Maria had often thought,
when disciplining her wayward heart,
"that to charm, was to be virtuous."
"They who make me wish to appear
the most amiable and good in their eyes,
must possess in a degree," she would
exclaim, "the graces and virtues they
call into action."</p>

<p>She took up a book on the powers of
the human mind; but, her attention
strayed from cold arguments on the
nature of what she felt, while she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-34" id="APg_1-34"></a>[<a href="images/v1-34.png">34</a>]</span>
feeling, and she snapt the chain of the
theory to read Dryden's Guiscard and
Sigismunda.</p>

<p>Maria, in the course of the ensuing
day, returned some of the books, with
the hope of getting others&mdash;and more
marginal notes. Thus shut out from
human intercourse, and compelled to
view nothing but the prison of vexed
spirits, to meet a wretch in the same
situation, was more surely to find a
friend, than to imagine a countryman
one, in a strange land, where the human
voice conveys no information to
the eager ear.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see the unfortunate
being to whom these books belong?"
asked Maria, when Jemima brought
her supper. "Yes. He sometimes
walks out, between five and six, before
the family is stirring, in the morning,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-35" id="APg_1-35"></a>[<a href="images/v1-35.png">35</a>]</span>
with two keepers; but even then his
hands are confined."</p>

<p>"What! is he so unruly?" enquired
Maria, with an accent of disappointment.</p>

<p>"No, not that I perceive," replied
Jemima; "but he has an untamed
look, a vehemence of eye, that excites
apprehension. Were his hands free,
he looks as if he could soon manage
both his guards: yet he appears
tranquil."</p>

<p>"If he be so strong, he must be
young," observed Maria.</p>

<p>"Three or four and thirty, I suppose;
but there is no judging of a
person in his situation."</p>

<p>"Are you sure that he is mad?"
interrupted Maria with eagerness. Jemima
quitted the room, without replying.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-36" id="APg_1-36"></a>[<a href="images/v1-36.png">36</a>]</span>
"No, no, he certainly is not!" exclaimed
Maria, answering herself;
"the man who could write those observations
was not disordered in his
intellects."</p>

<p>She sat musing, gazing at the moon,
and watching its motion as it seemed
to glide under the clouds. Then, preparing
for bed, she thought, "Of
what use could I be to him, or he to
me, if it be true that he is unjustly
confined?&mdash;Could he aid me to escape,
who is himself more closely watched?&mdash;Still
I should like to see him." She
went to bed, dreamed of her child,
yet woke exactly at half after five
o'clock, and starting up, only wrapped
a gown around her, and ran to the
window. The morning was chill, it
was the latter end of September; yet
she did not retire to warm herself and<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-37" id="APg_1-37"></a>[<a href="images/v1-37.png">37</a>]</span>
think in bed, till the sound of the
servants, moving about the house, convinced
her that the unknown would
not walk in the garden that morning.
She was ashamed at feeling disappointed;
and began to reflect, as an excuse
to herself, on the little objects which
attract attention when there is nothing
to divert the mind; and how difficult
it was for women to avoid growing
romantic, who have no active duties
or pursuits.</p>

<p>At breakfast, Jemima enquired whether
she understood French? for, unless
she did, the stranger's stock of
books was exhausted. Maria replied
in the affirmative; but forbore to ask
any more questions respecting the person
to whom they belonged. And Jemima
gave her a new subject for contemplation,
by describing the person<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-38" id="APg_1-38"></a>[<a href="images/v1-38.png">38</a>]</span>
of a lovely maniac, just brought into
an adjoining chamber. She was singing
the pathetic ballad of old Rob &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
with the most heart-melting
falls and pauses. Jemima had half-opened
the door, when she distinguished
her voice, and Maria stood close to it,
scarcely daring to respire, lest a modulation
should escape her, so exquisitely
sweet, so passionately wild. She
began with sympathy to pourtray to
herself another victim, when the lovely
warbler flew, as it were, from the
spray, and a torrent of unconnected
exclamations and questions burst from
her, interrupted by fits of laughter, so
horrid, that Maria shut the door, and,
turning her eyes up to heaven, exclaimed&mdash;"Gracious
God!"</p>

<p>Several minutes elapsed before Maria
could enquire respecting the ru<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-39" id="APg_1-39"></a>[<a href="images/v1-39.png">39</a>]</span>mour
of the house (for this poor
wretch was obviously not confined
without a cause); and then Jemima
could only tell her, that it was said,
"she had been married, against her
inclination, to a rich old man, extremely
jealous (no wonder, for she
was a charming creature); and that,
in consequence of his treatment, or
something which hung on her mind,
she had, during her first lying-in, lost
her senses."</p>

<p>What a subject of meditation&mdash;even
to the very confines of madness.</p>

<p>"Woman, fragile flower! why
were you suffered to adorn a world
exposed to the inroad of such stormy
elements?" thought Maria, while the
poor maniac's strain was still breathing
on her ear, and sinking into her very
soul.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-40" id="APg_1-40"></a>[<a href="images/v1-40.png">40</a>]</span>
Towards the evening, Jemima brought
her Rousseau's <i>Helo&iuml;se</i>; and she sat
reading with eyes and heart, till the
return of her guard to extinguish the
light. One instance of her kindness
was, the permitting Maria to have
one, till her own hour of retiring to
rest. She had read this work long
since; but now it seemed to open a
new world to her&mdash;the only one worth
inhabiting. Sleep was not to be
wooed; yet, far from being fatigued
by the restless rotation of thought, she
rose and opened her window, just as
the thin watery clouds of twilight
made the long silent shadows visible.
The air swept across her face with a
voluptuous freshness that thrilled to
her heart, awakening indefinable emotions;
and the sound of a waving
branch, or the twittering of a startled<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-41" id="APg_1-41"></a>[<a href="images/v1-41.png">41</a>]</span>
bird, alone broke the stillness of reposing
nature. Absorbed by the sublime
sensibility which renders the consciousness
of existence felicity, Maria
was happy, till an autumnal scent,
wafted by the breeze of morn from
the fallen leaves of the adjacent wood,
made her recollect that the season had
changed since her confinement; yet
life afforded no variety to solace an
afflicted heart. She returned dispirited
to her couch, and thought of her child
till the broad glare of day again invited
her to the window. She looked
not for the unknown, still how great
was her vexation at perceiving the
back of a man, certainly he, with his
two attendants, as he turned into a
side-path which led to the house! A
confused recollection of having seen
somebody who resembled him, imme<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-42" id="APg_1-42"></a>[<a href="images/v1-42.png">42</a>]</span>diately
occurred, to puzzle and torment
her with endless conjectures. Five
minutes sooner, and she should have
seen his face, and been out of suspense&mdash;was
ever any thing so unlucky!
His steady, bold step, and the whole
air of his person, bursting as it were
from a cloud, pleased her, and gave
an outline to the imagination to sketch
the individual form she wished to recognize.</p>

<p>Feeling the disappointment more
severely than she was willing to believe,
she flew to Rousseau, as her
only refuge from the idea of him, who
might prove a friend, could she but
find a way to interest him in her fate;
still the personification of Saint Preux,
or of an ideal lover far superior, was
after this imperfect model, of which
merely a glance had been caught,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-43" id="APg_1-43"></a>[<a href="images/v1-43.png">43</a>]</span>
even to the minuti&aelig; of the coat and
hat of the stranger. But if she lent
St. Preux, or the demi-god of her
fancy, his form, she richly repaid him
by the donation of all St. Preux's
sentiments and feelings, culled to gratify
her own, to which he seemed to
have an undoubted right, when she
read on the margin of an impassioned
letter, written in the well-known hand&mdash;"Rousseau
alone, the true Prometheus
of sentiment, possessed the fire
of genius necessary to pourtray the
passion, the truth of which goes so
directly to the heart."</p>

<p>Maria was again true to the hour, yet
had finished Rousseau, and begun to
transcribe some selected passages; unable
to quit either the author or the window,
before she had a glimpse of the
countenance she daily longed to see;<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-44" id="APg_1-44"></a>[<a href="images/v1-44.png">44</a>]</span>
and, when seen, it conveyed no distinct
idea to her mind where she had
seen it before. He must have been a
transient acquaintance; but to discover
an acquaintance was fortunate, could
she contrive to attract his attention,
and excite his sympathy.</p>

<p>Every glance afforded colouring for
the picture she was delineating on her
heart; and once, when the window
was half open, the sound of his voice
reached her. Conviction flashed on
her; she had certainly, in a moment
of distress, heard the same accents.
They were manly, and characteristic
of a noble mind; nay, even sweet&mdash;or
sweet they seemed to her attentive
ear.</p>

<p>She started back, trembling, alarmed
at the emotion a strange coincidence
of circumstances inspired, and wonder<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-45" id="APg_1-45"></a>[<a href="images/v1-45.png">45</a>]</span>ing
why she thought so much of a
stranger, obliged as she had been by
his timely interference; [for she recollected,
by degrees, all the circumstances
of their former meeting.] She
found however that she could think
of nothing else; or, if she thought of
her daughter, it was to wish that she
had a father whom her mother could
respect and love.</p>

<h2><a name="ACHAP_III" id="ACHAP_III"></a>CHAP. III.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> perusing the first parcel of
books, Maria had, with her pencil, written
in one of them a few exclamations,
expressive of compassion and sympathy,
which she scarcely remembered, till
turning over the leaves of one of the
volumes, lately brought to her, a slip
of paper dropped out, which Jemima
hastily snatched up.</p>

<p>"Let me see it," demanded Maria
impatiently, "You surely are not
afraid of trusting me with the effusions
of a madman?" "I must consider," replied
Jemima; and withdrew, with
the paper in her hand.</p>

<p>In a life of such seclusion, the passions
gain undue force; Maria therefore
felt a great degree of resentment and<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-47" id="APg_1-47"></a>[<a href="images/v1-47.png">47</a>]</span>
vexation, which she had not time to
subdue, before Jemima, returning, delivered
the paper.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Whoever you are, who partake of
my fate, accept my sincere commiseration&mdash;I
would have said protection;
but the privilege of man is denied me.</p>

<p>"My own situation forces a dreadful
suspicion on my mind&mdash;I may not always
languish in vain for freedom&mdash;say
are you&mdash;I cannot ask the question;
yet I will remember you when my remembrance
can be of any use. I will
enquire, <i>why</i> you are so mysteriously
detained&mdash;and I <i>will</i> have an answer.</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">henry darnford</span>."</p></div>

<p>By the most pressing intreaties, Maria
prevailed on Jemima to permit her to
write a reply to this note. Another<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-48" id="APg_1-48"></a>[<a href="images/v1-48.png">48</a>]</span>
and another succeeded, in which explanations
were not allowed relative to
their present situation; but Maria, with
sufficient explicitness, alluded to a former
obligation; and they insensibly entered
on an interchange of sentiments
on the most important subjects. To
write these letters was the business of
the day, and to receive them the moment
of sunshine. By some means,
Darnford having discovered Maria's
window, when she next appeared at
it, he made her, behind his keepers, a
profound bow of respect and recognition.</p>

<p>Two or three weeks glided away in
this kind of intercourse, during which
period Jemima, to whom Maria had
given the necessary information respecting
her family, had evidently gained
some intelligence, which increased her<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-49" id="APg_1-49"></a>[<a href="images/v1-49.png">49</a>]</span>
desire of pleasing her charge, though
she could not yet determine to liberate
her. Maria took advantage of this
favourable charge, without too minutely
enquiring into the cause; and such
was her eagerness to hold human converse,
and to see her former protector,
still a stranger to her, that she incessantly
requested her guard to gratify her more
than curiosity.</p>

<p>Writing to Darnford, she was led
from the sad objects before her, and
frequently rendered insensible to the
horrid noises around her, which previously
had continually employed her
feverish fancy. Thinking it selfish to
dwell on her own sufferings, when in
the midst of wretches, who had not
only lost all that endears life, but their
very selves, her imagination was oc<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-50" id="APg_1-50"></a>[<a href="images/v1-50.png">50</a>]</span>cupied
with melancholy earnestness to
trace the mazes of misery, through
which so many wretches must have
passed to this gloomy receptacle of disjointed
souls, to the grand source of
human corruption. Often at midnight
was she waked by the dismal shrieks of
demoniac rage, or of excruciating despair,
uttered in such wild tones of indescribable
anguish as proved the total
absence of reason, and roused phantoms
of horror in her mind, far more
terrific than all that dreaming superstition
ever drew. Besides, there was
frequently something so inconceivably
picturesque in the varying gestures of
unrestrained passion, so irresistibly comic
in their sallies, or so heart-piercingly
pathetic in the little airs they would
sing, frequently bursting out after an
awful silence, as to fascinate the at<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-51" id="APg_1-51"></a>[<a href="images/v1-51.png">51</a>]</span>tention,
and amuse the fancy, while
torturing the soul. It was the uproar
of the passions which she was compelled
to observe; and to mark the
lucid beam of reason, like a light
trembling in a socket, or like the
flash which divides the threatening
clouds of angry heaven only to display
the horrors which darkness shrouded.</p>

<p>Jemima would labour to beguile the
tedious evenings, by describing the
persons and manners of the <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'unfortutunate'">unfortunate</ins>
beings, whose figures or voices
awoke sympathetic sorrow in Maria's
bosom; and the stories she told were
the more interesting, for perpetually
leaving room to conjecture something
extraordinary. Still Maria, accustomed
to generalize her observations, was
led to conclude from all she heard,
that it was a vulgar error to suppose<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-52" id="APg_1-52"></a>[<a href="images/v1-52.png">52</a>]</span>
that people of abilities were the most
apt to lose the command of reason.
On the contrary, from most of the instances
she could investigate, she thought
it resulted, that the passions only appeared
strong and disproportioned, because
the judgment was weak and unexercised;
and that they gained strength
by the decay of reason, as the shadows
lengthen during the sun's decline.</p>

<p>Maria impatiently wished to see her
fellow-sufferer; but Darnford was still
more earnest to obtain an interview.
Accustomed to submit to every impulse
of passion, and never taught, like
women, to restrain the most natural,
and acquire, instead of the bewitching
frankness of nature, a factitious propriety
of behaviour, every desire became
a torrent that bore down all opposition.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-53" id="APg_1-53"></a>[<a href="images/v1-53.png">53</a>]</span>
His travelling trunk, which contained
the books lent to Maria, had
been sent to him, and with a part of
its contents he bribed his principal
keeper; who, after receiving the most
solemn promise that he would return
to his apartment without attempting
to explore any part of the house, conducted
him, in the dusk of the evening,
to Maria's room.</p>

<p>Jemima had apprized her charge of
the visit, and she expected with trembling
impatience, inspired by a vague
hope that he might again prove her
deliverer, to see a man who had before
rescued her from oppression. He entered
with an animation of countenance,
formed to captivate an enthusiast;
and, hastily turned his eyes from
her to the apartment, which he surveyed
with apparent emotions of com<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-54" id="APg_1-54"></a>[<a href="images/v1-54.png">54</a>]</span>passionate
indignation. Sympathy illuminated
his eye, and, taking her hand,
he respectfully bowed on it, exclaiming&mdash;"This
is extraordinary!&mdash;again
to meet you, and in such circumstances!"
Still, impressive as was the
coincidence of events which brought
them once more together, their full
hearts did not overflow.&mdash;<a name="AFNanchor_54-A_3" id="AFNanchor_54-A_3"></a><a href="#AFootnote_54-A_3" class="fnanchor">[54-A]</a></p>

<hr />

<p>[And though, after this first visit,
they were permitted frequently to repeat
their interviews, they were for
some time employed in] a reserved
conversation, to which all the world<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-55" id="APg_1-55"></a>[<a href="images/v1-55.png">55</a>]</span>
might have listened; excepting, when
discussing some literary subject, flashes
of sentiment, inforced by each relaxing
feature, seemed to remind them
that their minds were already acquainted.</p>

<p>[By degrees, Darnford entered into
the particulars of his story.] In a few
words, he informed her that he had been
a thoughtless, extravagant young man;
yet, as he described his faults, they appeared
to be the generous luxuriancy of
a noble mind. Nothing like meanness
tarnished the lustre of his youth, nor had
the worm of selfishness lurked in the unfolding
bud, even while he had been the
dupe of others. Yet he tardily acquired
the experience necessary to guard
him against future imposition.</p>

<p>"I shall weary you," continued he,
"by my egotism; and did not power<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-56" id="APg_1-56"></a>[<a href="images/v1-56.png">56</a>]</span>ful
emotions draw me to you,"&mdash;his
eyes glistened as he spoke, and a trembling
seemed to run through his manly
frame,&mdash;"I would not waste these precious
moments in talking of myself.</p>

<p>"My father and mother were people
of fashion; married by their parents. He
was fond of the turf, she of the card-table.
I, and two or three other children
since dead, were kept at home
till we became intolerable. My father
and mother had a visible dislike
to each other, continually displayed;
the servants were of the depraved kind
usually found in the houses of people
of fortune. My brothers and parents
all dying, I was left to the care of
guardians, and sent to Eton. I never
knew the sweets of domestic affection,
but I felt the want of indulgence and
frivolous respect at school. I will not<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-57" id="APg_1-57"></a>[<a href="images/v1-57.png">57</a>]</span>
disgust you with a recital of the vices
of my youth, which can scarcely be comprehended
by female delicacy. I was
taught to love by a creature I am
ashamed to mention; and the other
women with whom I afterwards became
intimate, were of a class of which
you can have no knowledge. I formed
my acquaintance with them at the
theatres; and, when vivacity danced
in their eyes, I was not easily disgusted
by the vulgarity which flowed from
their lips. Having spent, a few years
after I was of age, [the whole of] a
considerable patrimony, excepting a
few hundreds, I had no <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'resource'">recourse</ins> but
to purchase a commission in a new-raised
regiment, destined to subjugate
America. The regret I felt to renounce
a life of pleasure, was counter-balanced
by the curiosity I had to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-58" id="APg_1-58"></a>[<a href="images/v1-58.png">58</a>]</span>
America, or rather to travel; [nor
had any of those circumstances occurred
to my youth, which might have
been calculated] to bind my country
to my heart. I shall not trouble you
with the details of a military life. My
blood was still kept in motion; till,
towards the close of the contest, I was
wounded and taken prisoner.</p>

<p>"Confined to my bed, or chair, by a
lingering cure, my only refuge from
the preying activity of my mind, was
books, which I read with great avidity,
profiting by the conversation of my
host, a man of sound understanding.
My political sentiments now underwent
a total change; and, dazzled by
the hospitality of the Americans, I
determined to take up my abode with
freedom. I, therefore, with my usual
impetuosity, sold my commission, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-59" id="APg_1-59"></a>[<a href="images/v1-59.png">59</a>]</span>
travelled into the interior parts of the
country, to lay out my money to advantage.
Added to this, I did not
much like the puritanical manners of
the large towns. Inequality of condition
was there most disgustingly galling.
The only pleasure wealth afforded,
was to make an ostentatious
display of it; for the cultivation of
the fine arts, or literature, had not introduced
into the first circles that polish
of manners which renders the rich so essentially
superior to the poor in Europe.
Added to this, an influx of vices had
been let in by the Revolution, and the
most rigid principles of religion shaken
to the centre, before the understanding
could be gradually emancipated from
the prejudices which led their ancestors
undauntedly to seek an inhospitable
clime and unbroken soil. The resolu<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-60" id="APg_1-60"></a>[<a href="images/v1-60.png">60</a>]</span>tion,
that led them, in pursuit of independence,
to embark on rivers like
seas, to search for unknown shores,
and to sleep under the hovering mists
of endless forests, whose baleful damps
agued their limbs, was now turned into
commercial speculations, till the national
character exhibited a phenomenon
in the history of the human mind&mdash;a
head enthusiastically enterprising, with
cold selfishness of heart. And woman,
lovely woman!&mdash;they charm every
where&mdash;still there is a degree of prudery,
and a want of taste and ease in
the manners of the American women,
that renders them, in spite of their roses
and lilies, far inferior to our European
charmers. In the country, they have
often a bewitching simplicity of character;
but, in the cities, they have all
the airs and ignorance of the ladies who<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-61" id="APg_1-61"></a>[<a href="images/v1-61.png">61</a>]</span>
give the tone to the circles of the large
trading towns in England. They are
fond of their ornaments, merely because
they are good, and not because
they embellish their persons; and are
more gratified to inspire the women
with jealousy of these exterior advantages,
than the men with love. All
the frivolity which often (excuse me,
Madam) renders the society of modest
women so stupid in England, here
seemed to throw still more leaden fetters
on their charms. Not being an
adept in gallantry, I found that I could
only keep myself awake in their company
by making downright love to
them.</p>

<p>"But, not to intrude on your patience,
I retired to the track of land
which I had purchased in the country,
and my time passed pleasantly enough<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-62" id="APg_1-62"></a>[<a href="images/v1-62.png">62</a>]</span>
while I cut down the trees, built my
house, and planted my different crops.
But winter and idleness came, and I
longed for more elegant society, to hear
what was passing in the world, and to
do something better than vegetate with
the animals that made a very considerable
part of my household. Consequently,
I determined to travel. Motion was
a substitute for variety of objects; and,
passing over immense tracks of country,
I exhausted my exuberant spirits, without
obtaining much experience. I every
where saw industry the fore-runner
and not the consequence, of luxury;
but this country, every thing being on
an ample scale, did not afford those
picturesque views, which a certain degree
of cultivation is necessary gradually
to produce. The eye wandered
without an object to fix upon over im<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-63" id="APg_1-63"></a>[<a href="images/v1-63.png">63</a>]</span>measureable
plains, and lakes that seemed
replenished by the ocean, whilst eternal
forests of small clustering trees, obstructed
the circulation of air, and embarrassed
the path, without gratifying
the eye of taste. No cottage smiling in
the waste, no travellers hailed us, to give
life to silent nature; or, if perchance
we saw the print of a footstep in our
path, it was a dreadful warning to turn
aside; and the head ached as if assailed
by the scalping knife. The Indians
who hovered on the skirts of the European
settlements had only learned of
their neighbours to plunder, and they
stole their guns from them to do it with
more safety.</p>

<p>"From the woods and back settlements,
I returned to the towns, and
learned to eat and drink most valiantly;
but without entering into commerce<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-64" id="APg_1-64"></a>[<a href="images/v1-64.png">64</a>]</span>
(and I detested commerce) I found I
could not live there; and, growing heartily
weary of the land of liberty and
vulgar aristocracy, seated on her bags
of dollars, I resolved once more to visit
Europe. I wrote to a distant relation
in England, with whom I had been
educated, mentioning the vessel in
which I intended to sail. Arriving in
London, my senses were intoxicated. I
ran from street to street, from theatre
to theatre, and the women of the town
(again I must beg pardon for my habitual
frankness) appeared to me like
angels.</p>

<p>"A week was spent in this thoughtless
manner, when, returning very late
to the hotel in which I had lodged ever
since my arrival, I was knocked down
in a private street, and hurried, in a state
of insensibility, into a coach, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-65" id="APg_1-65"></a>[<a href="images/v1-65.png">65</a>]</span>
brought me hither, and I only recovered
my senses to be treated like one
who had lost them. My keepers are
deaf to my remonstrances and enquiries,
yet assure me that my confinement
shall not last long. Still I cannot guess,
though I weary myself with conjectures,
why I am confined, or in what
part of England this house is situated.
I imagine sometimes that I hear the
sea roar, and wished myself again on
the Atlantic, till I had a glimpse of
you<a name="AFNanchor_65-A_4" id="AFNanchor_65-A_4"></a><a href="#AFootnote_65-A_4" class="fnanchor">[65-A]</a>."</p>

<p>A few moments were only allowed to
Maria to comment on this narrative,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-66" id="APg_1-66"></a>[<a href="images/v1-66.png">66</a>]</span>
when Darnford left her to her own
thoughts, to the "never ending, still
beginning," task of weighing his words,
recollecting his tones of voice, and feeling

<h2><a name="ACHAP_IV" id="ACHAP_IV"></a>CHAP. IV.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Pity</span>, and the forlorn seriousness of
adversity, have both been considered as
dispositions favourable to love, while
satirical writers have attributed the
propensity to the relaxing effect of
<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing comma">idleness,</ins> what chance then had Maria
of escaping, when pity, sorrow,
and solitude all conspired to soften her
mind, and nourish romantic wishes,
and, from a natural progress, romantic
expectations?</p>

<p>Maria was six-and-twenty. But,
such was the native soundness of her
constitution, that time had only given
to her countenance the character of her
mind. Revolving thought, and exercised
affections had banished some of<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-68" id="APg_1-68"></a>[<a href="images/v1-68.png">68</a>]</span>
the playful graces of innocence, producing
insensibly that irregularity of
features which the struggles of the understanding
to trace or govern the
strong emotions of the heart, are wont
to imprint on the yielding mass. Grief
and care had mellowed, without obscuring,
the bright tints of youth, and
the thoughtfulness which resided on her
brow did not take from the feminine
softness of her features; nay, such was
the sensibility which often mantled over
it, that she frequently appeared, like a
large proportion of her sex, only born
to feel; and the activity of her well-proportioned,
and even almost voluptuous
figure, inspired the idea of
strength of mind, rather than of body.
There was a simplicity sometimes indeed
in her manner, which bordered
on infantine ingenuousness, that led peo<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-69" id="APg_1-69"></a>[<a href="images/v1-69.png">69</a>]</span>ple
of common discernment to underrate
her talents, and smile at the flights
of her imagination. But those who
could not comprehend the delicacy of
her sentiments, were attached by her
unfailing sympathy, so that she was very
generally beloved by characters of very
different descriptions; still, she was too
much under the influence of an ardent
imagination to adhere to common rules.</p>

<p>There are mistakes of conduct which
at five-and-twenty prove the strength of
the mind, that, ten or fifteen years after,
would demonstrate its weakness, its incapacity
to acquire a sane judgment.
The youths who are satisfied with the
ordinary pleasures of life, and do not
sigh after ideal phantoms of love and
friendship, will never arrive at great maturity
of understanding; but if these reveries
are cherished, as is too frequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-70" id="APg_1-70"></a>[<a href="images/v1-70.png">70</a>]</span>
the case with women, when experience
ought to have taught them in what human
happiness consists, they become as
useless as they are wretched. Besides,
their pains and pleasures are so dependent
on outward circumstances, on the
objects of their affections, that they
seldom act from the impulse of a nerved
mind, able to choose its own pursuit.</p>

<p>Having had to struggle incessantly
with the vices of mankind, Maria's
imagination found repose in pourtraying
the possible virtues the world might
contain. Pygmalion formed an ivory
maid, and longed for an informing soul.
She, on the contrary, combined all the
qualities of a hero's mind, and fate
presented a statue in which she might
enshrine them.</p>

<p>We mean not to trace the progress
of this passion, or recount how often<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-71" id="APg_1-71"></a>[<a href="images/v1-71.png">71</a>]</span>
Darnford and Maria were obliged to
part in the midst of an interesting conversation.
Jemima ever watched on
the tip-toe of fear, and frequently separated
them on a false alarm, when
they would have given worlds to remain
a little longer together.</p>

<p>A magic lamp now seemed to be suspended
in Maria's prison, and fairy
landscapes flitted round the gloomy
walls, late so blank. Rushing from the
depth of despair, on the seraph wing of
hope, she found herself happy.&mdash;She was
beloved, and every emotion was rapturous.</p>

<p>To Darnford she had not shown a decided
affection; the fear of outrunning
his, a sure proof of love, made her often
assume a coldness and indifference foreign
from her character; and, even when
giving way to the playful emotions of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-72" id="APg_1-72"></a>[<a href="images/v1-72.png">72</a>]</span>
heart just loosened from the frozen
bond of grief, there was a delicacy in
her manner of expressing her sensibility,
which made him doubt whether it
was the effect of love.</p>

<p>One evening, when Jemima left them,
to listen to the sound of a distant footstep,
which seemed cautiously to approach,
he seized Maria's hand&mdash;it was
not withdrawn. They conversed with
earnestness of their situation; and, during
the conversation, he once or twice
gently drew her towards him. He felt
the fragrance of her breath, and longed,
yet feared, to touch the lips from
which it issued; spirits of purity seemed
to guard them, while all the enchanting
graces of love sported on her cheeks,
and languished in her eyes.</p>

<p>Jemima entering, he reflected on his
diffidence with poignant regret, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-73" id="APg_1-73"></a>[<a href="images/v1-73.png">73</a>]</span>
she once more taking alarm, he ventured,
as Maria stood near his chair, to
approach her lips with a declaration of
love. She drew back with solemnity,
he hung down his head abashed; but
lifting his eyes timidly, they met her's;
she had determined, during that instant,
and suffered their rays to mingle. He
took, with more ardour, reassured, a
half-consenting, half-reluctant kiss, reluctant
only from modesty; and there
was a sacredness in her dignified manner
of reclining her glowing face on
his shoulder, that powerfully impressed
him. Desire was lost in more ineffable
emotions, and to protect her from insult
and sorrow&mdash;to make her happy,
seemed not only the first wish of his heart,
but the most noble duty of his life.
Such angelic confidence demanded the
fidelity of honour; but could he, feel<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-74" id="APg_1-74"></a>[<a href="images/v1-74.png">74</a>]</span>ing
her in every pulsation, could he
ever change, could he be a villain? The
emotion with which she, for a moment,
allowed herself to be pressed to his bosom,
the tear of rapturous sympathy,
mingled with a soft melancholy sentiment
of recollected disappointment,
said&mdash;more of truth and faithfulness,
than the tongue could have given utterance
to in hours! They were silent&mdash;yet
discoursed, how eloquently? till,
after a moment's reflection, Maria drew
her chair by the side of his, and, with
a composed sweetness of voice, and
supernatural benignity of countenance,
said, "I must open my whole heart
to you; you must be told who I am,
why I am here, and why, telling you
I am a wife, I blush not to"&mdash;the blush
spoke the rest.</p>

<p>Jemima was again at her elbow, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-75" id="APg_1-75"></a>[<a href="images/v1-75.png">75</a>]</span>
the restraint of her presence did not
prevent an animated conversation, in
which love, sly urchin, was ever at bo-peep.</p>

<p>So much of heaven did they enjoy,
that paradise bloomed around them; or
they, by a powerful spell, had been
transported into Armida's garden. Love,
the grand enchanter, "lapt them in Elysium,"
and every sense was harmonized
to joy and social extacy. So animated,
indeed, were their accents of tenderness,
in discussing what, in other circumstances,
would have been common-place
subjects, that Jemima felt, with
surprise, a tear of pleasure trickling
down her rugged cheeks. She wiped
it away, half ashamed; and when Maria
kindly enquired the cause, with all
the eager solicitude of a happy being
wishing to impart to all nature its<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-76" id="APg_1-76"></a>[<a href="images/v1-76.png">76</a>]</span>
overflowing felicity, Jemima owned
that it was the first tear that social enjoyment
had ever drawn from her. She
seemed indeed to breathe more freely;
the cloud of suspicion cleared away
from her brow; she felt herself, for
once in her life, treated like a fellow-creature.</p>

<p>Imagination! who can paint thy
power; or reflect the evanescent tints
of hope fostered by thee? A despondent
gloom had long obscured Maria's horizon&mdash;now
the sun broke forth, the
rainbow appeared, and every prospect
was fair. Horror still reigned in the
darkened cells, suspicion lurked in the
passages, and whispered along the
walls. The yells of men possessed,
sometimes made them pause, and wonder
that they felt so happy, in a tomb
of living death. They even chid them<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-77" id="APg_1-77"></a>[<a href="images/v1-77.png">77</a>]</span>selves
for such apparent insensibility;
still the world contained not three happier
beings. And Jemima, after again
patrolling the passage, was so softened
by the air of confidence which breathed
around her, that she voluntarily began
an account of herself.</p>

<hr class="full" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-78" id="APg_1-78"></a>[<a href="images/v1-78.png">78</a>]</span></p>
<h2><a name="ACHAP_V" id="ACHAP_V"></a>CHAP. V.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">My</span> father," said Jemima, "seduced
my mother, a pretty girl, with whom
he lived fellow-servant; and she no
sooner perceived the natural, the dreaded
consequence, than the terrible conviction
flashed on her&mdash;that she was
ruined. Honesty, and a regard for her
reputation, had been the only principles
inculcated by her mother; and
they had been so forcibly impressed, that
she feared shame, more than the poverty
to which it would lead. Her incessant
importunities to prevail upon my father
to screen her from reproach by marrying
her, as he had promised in the
fervour of seduction, estranged him from
her so completely, that her very person<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-79" id="APg_1-79"></a>[<a href="images/v1-79.png">79</a>]</span>
became distasteful to him; and he began
to hate, as well as despise me, before
I was born.</p>

<p>"My mother, grieved to the soul by
his neglect, and unkind treatment, actually
resolved to famish herself; and
injured her health by the attempt;
though she had not sufficient resolution
to adhere to her project, or renounce it
entirely. Death came not at her call;
yet sorrow, and the methods she adopted
to conceal her condition, still doing the
work of a house-maid, had such an
effect on her constitution, that she died
in the wretched garret, where her virtuous
mistress had forced her to take
refuge in the very pangs of labour,
though my father, after a slight reproof,
was allowed to remain in his place&mdash;allowed
by the mother of six children,
who, scarcely permitting a footstep to<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-80" id="APg_1-80"></a>[<a href="images/v1-80.png">80</a>]</span>
be heard, during her month's indulgence,
felt no sympathy for the poor
wretch, denied every comfort required
by her situation.</p>

<p>"The day my mother died, the
ninth after my birth, I was consigned
to the care of the cheapest nurse my
father could find; who suckled her own
child at the same time, and lodged as
many more as she could get, in two
cellar-like apartments.</p>

<p>"Poverty, and the habit of seeing
children die off her hands, had so
hardened her heart, that the office of a
mother did not awaken the tenderness
of a woman; nor were the feminine
caresses which seem a part of the rearing
of a child, ever bestowed on me.
The chicken has a wing to shelter under;
but I had no bosom to nestle in,
no kindred warmth to foster me. Left<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-81" id="APg_1-81"></a>[<a href="images/v1-81.png">81</a>]</span>
in dirt, to cry with cold and hunger
till I was weary, and sleep without ever
being prepared by exercise, or lulled
by kindness to rest; could I be expected
to become any thing but a weak and
rickety babe? Still, in spite of neglect,
I continued to exist, to learn to
curse existence,<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Errata: original reads '['">"</ins> her countenance grew
ferocious as she spoke, <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Errata: original reads ']'">"</ins>and the treatment
that rendered me miserable, seemed
to sharpen my wits. Confined then
in a damp hovel, to rock the cradle of
the succeeding tribe, I looked like a
little old woman, or a hag shrivelling into
nothing. The furrows of reflection and
care contracted the youthful cheek,
and gave a sort of supernatural wildness
to the ever watchful eye. During
this period, my father had married another
fellow-servant, who loved him
less, and knew better how to manage<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-82" id="APg_1-82"></a>[<a href="images/v1-82.png">82</a>]</span>
his passion, than my mother. She likewise
proving with child, they agreed
to keep a shop: my step-mother, if, being
an illegitimate offspring, I may
venture thus to characterize her, having
obtained a sum of a rich relation,
for that purpose.</p>

<p>"Soon after her lying-in, she prevailed
on my father to take me home, to save
the expence of maintaining me, and
of hiring a girl to assist her in the care
of the child. I was young, it was true,
but appeared a knowing little thing,
and might be made handy. Accordingly
I was brought to her house; but
not to a home&mdash;for a home I never
knew. Of this child, a daughter, she
was extravagantly fond; and it was a
part of my employment, to assist to spoil
her, by humouring all her whims, and
bearing all her caprices. Feeling her<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-83" id="APg_1-83"></a>[<a href="images/v1-83.png">83</a>]</span>
own consequence, before she could
speak, she had learned the art of tormenting
me, and if I ever dared to resist,
I received blows, laid on with no
compunctious hand, or was sent to bed
dinnerless, as well as supperless. I said
that it was a part of my daily labour to
attend this child, with the servility of a
slave; still it was but a part. I was
sent out in all seasons, and from place
to place, to carry burdens far above
my strength, without being allowed to
draw near the fire, or ever being
cheered by encouragement or kindness.
No wonder then, treated like a
creature of another species, that I began
to envy, and at length to hate,
the darling of the house. Yet, I perfectly
remember, that it was the caresses,
and kind expressions of my step-mother,
which first excited my jealous<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-84" id="APg_1-84"></a>[<a href="images/v1-84.png">84</a>]</span>
discontent. Once, I cannot forget it,
when she was calling in vain her wayward
child to kiss her, I ran to her,
saying, 'I will kiss you, ma'am!' and
how did my heart, which was in my
mouth, sink, what was my debasement
of soul, when pushed away with&mdash;'I
do not want you, pert thing!'
Another day, when a new gown had
excited the highest good humour, and
she uttered the appropriate <i>dear</i>, addressed
unexpectedly to me, I thought
I could never do enough to please her;
I was all alacrity, and rose proportionably
in my own estimation.</p>

<p>"As her daughter grew up, she was
pampered with cakes and fruit, while
I was, literally speaking, fed with the
refuse of the table, with her leavings.
A liquorish tooth is, I believe, common
to children, and I used to steal any<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-85" id="APg_1-85"></a>[<a href="images/v1-85.png">85</a>]</span>
thing sweet, that I could catch up with
a chance of concealment. When detected,
she was not content to chastize
me herself at the moment, but, on my
father's return in the evening (he was
a shopman), the principal discourse was
to recount my faults, and attribute
them to the wicked disposition which I
had brought into the world with me,
inherited from my mother. He did not
fail to leave the marks of his resentment
on my body, and then solaced
himself by playing with my sister.&mdash;I
could have murdered her at those moments.
To save myself from these unmerciful
corrections, I resorted to falshood,
and the untruths which I sturdily
maintained, were brought in judgment
against me, to support my tyrant's
inhuman charge of my natural propensity
to vice. Seeing me treated with<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-86" id="APg_1-86"></a>[<a href="images/v1-86.png">86</a>]</span>
contempt, and always being fed and
dressed better, my sister conceived a
contemptuous opinion of me, that
proved an obstacle to all affection; and
my father, hearing continually of my
faults, began to consider me as a curse
entailed on him for his sins: he was
therefore easily prevailed on to bind
me apprentice to one of my step-mother's
friends, who kept a slop-shop in
Wapping. I was represented (as it
was said) in my true colours; but she,
'warranted,' snapping her fingers,
'that she should break my spirit or
heart.'</p>

<p>"My mother replied, with a whine,
'that if any body could make me better,
it was such a clever woman as herself;
though, for her own part, she had
tried in vain; but good-nature was her
fault.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-87" id="APg_1-87"></a>[<a href="images/v1-87.png">87</a>]</span>
"I shudder with horror, when I recollect
the treatment I had now to endure.
Not only under the lash of my task-mistress,
but the drudge of the maid,
apprentices and children, I never had
a taste of human kindness to soften the
rigour of perpetual labour. I had been
introduced as an object of abhorrence
into the family; as a creature of whom
my step-mother, though she had been
kind enough to let me live in the house
with her own child, could make nothing.
I was described as a wretch,
whose nose must be kept to the grinding
stone&mdash;and it was held there with
an iron grasp. It seemed indeed the
privilege of their superior nature to kick
me about, like the dog or cat. If I
were attentive, I was called fawning,
if refractory, an obstinate mule, and
like a mule I received their censure on<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-88" id="APg_1-88"></a>[<a href="images/v1-88.png">88</a>]</span>
my loaded back. Often has my mistress,
for some instance of forgetfulness, thrown
me from one side of the kitchen to the
other, knocked my head against the
wall, spit in my face, with various refinements
on barbarity that I forbear to
enumerate, though they were all acted
over again by the servant, with additional
insults, to which the appellation
of <i>bastard</i>, was commonly added, with
taunts or sneers. But I will not attempt
to give you an adequate idea of
my situation, lest you, who probably
have never been drenched with the
dregs of human misery, should think I
exaggerate.</p>

<p>"I stole now, from absolute necessity,&mdash;bread;
yet whatever else was
taken, which I had it not in my power
to take, was ascribed to me. I was
the filching cat, the ravenous dog, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-89" id="APg_1-89"></a>[<a href="images/v1-89.png">89</a>]</span>
dumb brute, who must bear all; for if
I endeavoured to exculpate myself, I
was silenced, without any enquiries
being made, with 'Hold your tongue,
you never tell truth.' Even the very
air I breathed was tainted with scorn;
for I was sent to the neighbouring shops
with Glutton, Liar, or Thief, written on
my forehead. This was, at first, the
most bitter punishment; but sullen
pride, or a kind of stupid desperation,
made me, at length, almost regardless
of the contempt, which had wrung
from me so many solitary tears at the
only moments when I was allowed to
rest.</p>

<p>"Thus was I the mark of cruelty till
my sixteenth year; and then I have
only to point out a change of misery;
for a period I never knew. Allow me
first to make one observation. Now I<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-90" id="APg_1-90"></a>[<a href="images/v1-90.png">90</a>]</span>
look back, I cannot help attributing the
greater part of my misery, to the misfortune
of having been thrown into the
world without the grand support of life&mdash;a
mother's affection. I had no one to
love me; or to make me respected, to
enable me to acquire respect. I was an
egg dropped on the sand; a pauper by
nature, <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'hunted'">shunted</ins> from family to family,
who belonged to nobody&mdash;and nobody
cared for me. I was despised from my
birth, and denied the chance of obtaining
a footing for myself in society. Yes;
I had not even the chance of being
considered as a fellow-creature&mdash;yet all
the people with whom I lived, brutalized
as they were by the low cunning
of trade, and the despicable shifts of
poverty, were not without bowels,
though they never yearned for me. I
was, in fact, born a slave, and chained<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-91" id="APg_1-91"></a>[<a href="images/v1-91.png">91</a>]</span>
by infamy to slavery during the whole
of existence, without having any companions
to alleviate it by sympathy, or
teach me how to rise above it by their
example. But, to resume the thread of
my tale&mdash;</p>

<p>"At sixteen, I suddenly grew tall,
and something like comeliness appeared
on a Sunday, when I had time to wash
my face, and put on clean clothes. My
master had once or twice caught hold
of me in the passage; but I instinctively
avoided his disgusting caresses. One
day however, when the family were
at a methodist meeting, he contrived to
be alone in the house with me, and by
blows&mdash;yes; blows and menaces, compelled
me to submit to his ferocious
desire; and, to avoid my mistress's
fury, I was obliged in future to comply,
and skulk to my loft at his com<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-92" id="APg_1-92"></a>[<a href="images/v1-92.png">92</a>]</span>mand,
in spite of increasing loathing.</p>

<p>"The anguish which was now pent
up in my bosom, seemed to open a new
world to me: I began to extend my
thoughts beyond myself, and grieve
for human misery, till I discovered,
with horror&mdash;ah! what horror!&mdash;that I
was with child. I know not why I felt
a mixed sensation of despair and tenderness,
excepting that, ever called a
bastard, a bastard appeared to me an
object of the greatest compassion in
creation.</p>

<p>"I communicated this dreadful circumstance
to my master, who was almost
equally alarmed at the intelligence;
for he feared his wife, and public
censure at the meeting. After some
weeks of deliberation had elapsed, I in
continual fear that my altered shape<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-93" id="APg_1-93"></a>[<a href="images/v1-93.png">93</a>]</span>
would be noticed, my master gave me
a medicine in a phial, which he desired
me to take, telling me, without any
circumlocution, for what purpose it
was designed. I burst into tears, I
thought it was killing myself&mdash;yet was
such a self as I worth preserving? He
cursed me for a fool, and left me to my
own reflections. I could not resolve to
take this infernal potion; but I wrapped
it up in an old gown, and hid it
in a corner of my box.</p>

<p>"Nobody yet suspected me, because
they had been accustomed to view me
as a creature of another species. But
the threatening storm at last broke over
my devoted head&mdash;never shall I forget
it! One Sunday evening when I was
left, as usual, to take care of the house,
my master came home intoxicated, and
I became the prey of his brutal appe<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-94" id="APg_1-94"></a>[<a href="images/v1-94.png">94</a>]</span>tite.
His extreme intoxication made
him forget his customary caution, and
my mistress entered and found us in a
situation that could not have been more
hateful to her than me. Her husband
was 'pot-valiant,' he feared her not
at the moment, nor had he then much
reason, for she instantly turned the
whole force of her anger another
way. She tore off my cap, scratched,
kicked, and buffetted me, till she had
exhausted her strength, declaring, as she
rested her arm, 'that I had wheedled
her husband from her.&mdash;But, could any
thing better be expected from a wretch,
whom she had taken into her house out
of pure charity?' What a torrent of
abuse rushed out? till, almost breathless,
she concluded with saying, 'that I
was born a strumpet; it ran in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-95" id="APg_1-95"></a>[<a href="images/v1-95.png">95</a>]</span>
blood, and nothing good could come
to those who harboured me.'</p>

<p>"My situation was, of course, discovered,
and she declared that I should
not stay another night under the same
roof with an honest family. I was
therefore pushed out of doors, and my
trumpery thrown after me, when it had
been contemptuously examined in the
passage, lest I should have stolen any
thing.</p>

<p>"Behold me then in the street, utterly
destitute! Whither could I creep for
shelter? To my father's roof I had no
claim, when not pursued by shame&mdash;now
I shrunk back as from death, from
my mother's cruel reproaches, my father's
execrations. I could not endure
to hear him curse the day I was born,
though life had been a curse to me. Of
death I thought, but with a confused<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-96" id="APg_1-96"></a>[<a href="images/v1-96.png">96</a>]</span>
emotion of terror, as I stood leaning
my head on a post, and starting at every
footstep, lest it should be my mistress
coming to tear my heart out. One of
the boys of the shop passing by, heard
my tale, and immediately repaired to
his master, to give him a description of
my situation; and he touched the right
key&mdash;the scandal it would give rise to,
if I were left to repeat my tale to every
enquirer. This plea came home to his
reason, who had been sobered by his
wife's rage, the fury of which fell on
him when I was out of her reach, and
he sent the boy to me with half-a-guinea,
desiring him to conduct me to a
house, where beggars, and other
wretches, the refuse of society, nightly
lodged.</p>

<p>"This night was spent in a state of
stupefaction, or desperation. I detested
mankind, and abhorred myself.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-97" id="APg_1-97"></a>[<a href="images/v1-97.png">97</a>]</span>
"In the morning I ventured out, to
throw myself in my master's way, at his
usual hour of going abroad. I approached
him, he 'damned me for a
b&mdash;&mdash;, declared I had disturbed the
peace of the family, and that he had
sworn to his wife, never to take any
more notice of me.' He left me; but,
instantly returning, he told me that he
should speak to his friend, a parish-officer,
to get a nurse for the brat I laid
to him; and advised me, if I wished to
keep out of the house of correction, not
to make free with his name.</p>

<p>"I hurried back to my hole, and, rage
giving place to despair, sought for the
potion that was to procure abortion, and
swallowed it, with a wish that it might
destroy me, at the same time that it
stopped the sensations of new-born life,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-98" id="APg_1-98"></a>[<a href="images/v1-98.png">98</a>]</span>
which I felt with indescribable emotion.
My head turned round, my heart grew
sick, and in the horrors of approaching
dissolution, mental anguish was swallowed
up. The effect of the medicine
was violent, and I was confined to my
bed several days; but, youth and a
strong constitution prevailing, I once
more crawled out, to ask myself the
cruel question, 'Whither I should
go?' I had but two shillings left in
my pocket, the rest had been expended,
by a poor woman who slept in the
same room, to pay for my lodging,
and purchase the necessaries of which
she partook.</p>

<p>"With this wretch I went into the
neighbouring streets to beg, and my
disconsolate appearance drew a few
pence from the idle, enabling me still
to command a bed; till, recovering<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-99" id="APg_1-99"></a>[<a href="images/v1-99.png">99</a>]</span>
from my illness, and taught to put on
my rags to the best advantage, I was
accosted from different motives, and
yielded to the desire of the brutes I met,
with the same detestation that I had
felt for my still more brutal master.
I have since read in novels of the blandishments
of seduction, but I had not
even the pleasure of being enticed
into vice.</p>

<p>"I shall not," interrupted Jemima,
"lead your imagination into all the
scenes of wretchedness and depravity,
which I was condemned to view; or
mark the different stages of my debasing
misery. Fate dragged me
through the very kennels of society;
I was still a slave, a bastard, a common
property. Become familiar with vice,
for I wish to conceal nothing from you,
I picked the pockets of the drunkards<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-100" id="APg_1-100"></a>[<a href="images/v1-100.png">100</a>]</span>
who abused me; and proved by my
conduct, that I deserved the epithets,
with which they loaded me at moments
when distrust ought to cease.</p>

<p>"Detesting my nightly occupation,
though valuing, if I may so use the
word, my independence, which only
consisted in choosing the street in which
I should wander, or the roof, when I
had money, in which I should hide my
head, I was some time before I could
prevail on myself to accept of a place
in a house of ill fame, to which a girl,
with whom I had accidentally conversed
in the street, had recommended
me. I had been hunted almost into a
a fever, by the watchmen of the quarter
of the town I frequented; one,
whom I had unwittingly offended, giving
the word to the whole pack. You
can scarcely conceive the tyranny ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-101" id="APg_1-101"></a>[<a href="images/v1-101.png">101</a>]</span>ercised
by these wretches: considering
themselves as the instruments of
the very laws they violate, the pretext
which steels their conscience, hardens
their heart. Not content with receiving
from us, outlaws of society (let
other women talk of favours) a brutal
gratification gratuitously as a privilege
of office, they extort a tithe of prostitution,
and harrass with threats the
poor creatures whose occupation affords
not the means to silence the growl of
avarice. To escape from this persecution,
I once more entered into servitude.</p>

<p>"A life of comparative regularity
restored my health; and&mdash;do not start&mdash;my
manners were improved, in a situation
where vice sought to render itself
alluring, and taste was cultivated to
fashion the person, if not to refine the
mind. Besides, the common civility of<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-102" id="APg_1-102"></a>[<a href="images/v1-102.png">102</a>]</span>
speech, contrasted with the gross vulgarity
to which I had been accustomed,
was something like the polish of civilization.
I was not shut out from all intercourse
of humanity. Still I was galled
by the yoke of service, and my mistress
often flying into violent fits of passion,
made me dread a sudden dismission,
which I understood was always the
case. I was therefore prevailed on,
though I felt a horror of men, to accept
the offer of a gentleman, rather in the
decline of years, to keep his house,
pleasantly situated in a little village
near Hampstead.</p>

<p>"He was a man of great talents, and
of brilliant wit; but, a worn-out votary
of voluptuousness, his desires became
fastidious in proportion as they
grew weak, and the native tenderness
of his heart was undermined by a vi<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-103" id="APg_1-103"></a>[<a href="images/v1-103.png">103</a>]</span>tiated
imagination. A thoughtless <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'carreer'">career</ins>
of libertinism and social enjoyment,
had injured his health to such a
degree, that, whatever pleasure his conversation
afforded me (and my esteem
was ensured by proofs of the generous
humanity of his disposition), the being
his mistress was purchasing it at a very
dear rate. With such a keen perception
of the delicacies of sentiment,
with an imagination invigorated by
the exercise of genius, how could he
sink into the grossness of sensuality!</p>

<p>"But, to pass over a subject which I
recollect with pain, I must remark to
you, as an answer to your often-repeated
question, 'Why my sentiments and
language were superior to my station?'
that I now began to read, to beguile
the tediousness of solitude, and to
gratify an inquisitive, active mind. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-104" id="APg_1-104"></a>[<a href="images/v1-104.png">104</a>]</span>
had often, in my childhood, followed a
ballad-singer, to hear the sequel of a
dismal story, though sure of being severely
punished for delaying to return
with whatever I was sent to purchase. I
could just spell and put a sentence together,
and I listened to the various arguments,
though often mingled with
obscenity, which occurred at the table
where I was allowed to preside: for a
literary friend or two frequently came
home with my master, to dine and pass
the night. Having lost the privileged respect
of my sex, my presence, instead
of restraining, perhaps gave the reins
to their tongues; still I had the advantage
of hearing discussions, from which,
in the common course of life, women
are excluded.</p>

<p>"You may easily imagine, that it
was only by degrees that I could com<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-105" id="APg_1-105"></a>[<a href="images/v1-105.png">105</a>]</span>prehend
some of the subjects they investigated,
or acquire from their reasoning
what might be termed a moral
sense. But my fondness of reading increasing,
and my master occasionally
shutting himself up in this retreat, for
weeks together, to write, I had many
opportunities of improvement. At
first, considering money <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '(I was right!&quot; exclaimed'">I was right!" (</ins>exclaimed Jemima, altering her tone of
voice) "as the only means, after my loss
of reputation, of obtaining respect, or
even the toleration of humanity, I had
not the least scruple to secrete a part of
the sums intrusted to me, and to screen
myself from detection by a system of
falshood. But, acquiring new principles,
I began to have the ambition of
returning to the respectable part of society,
and was weak enough to suppose
it possible. The attention of my unas<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-106" id="APg_1-106"></a>[<a href="images/v1-106.png">106</a>]</span>suming
instructor, who, without being
ignorant of his own powers, possessed
great simplicity of manners, strengthened
the illusion. Having sometimes
caught up hints for thought, from my
untutored remarks, he often led me to
discuss the subjects he was treating,
and would read to me his productions,
previous to their publication, wishing
to profit by the criticism of unsophisticated
feeling. The aim of his writings
was to touch the simple springs of
the heart; for he despised the would-be
oracles, the self-elected philosophers,
who fright away fancy, while sifting
each grain of thought to prove that
slowness of comprehension is wisdom.</p>

<p>"I should have distinguished this as
a moment of sunshine, a happy period
in my life, had not the repugnance the
disgusting libertinism of my protector<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-107" id="APg_1-107"></a>[<a href="images/v1-107.png">107</a>]</span>
inspired, daily become more painful.&mdash;And,
indeed, I soon did recollect it as
such with agony, when his sudden
death (for he had recourse to the most
exhilarating cordials to keep up the
convivial tone of his spirits) again
threw me into the desert of human society.
Had he had any time for reflection,
I am certain he would have
left the little property in his power to
me: but, attacked by the fatal apoplexy
in town, his heir, a man of
rigid morals, brought his wife with
him to take possession of the house and
effects, before I was even informed of
his death,&mdash;'to prevent,' as she took
care indirectly to tell me, 'such a
creature as she supposed me to be, from
purloining any of them, had I been
apprized of the event in time.'</p>

<p>"The grief I felt at the sudden<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-108" id="APg_1-108"></a>[<a href="images/v1-108.png">108</a>]</span>
shock the information gave me, which
at first had nothing selfish in it, was
treated with contempt, and I was ordered
to pack up my clothes; and a few
trinkets and books, given me by the
generous deceased, were contested,
while they piously hoped, with a reprobating
shake of the head, 'that
God would have mercy on his sinful
soul!' With some difficulty, I obtained
my arrears of wages; but asking&mdash;such
is the spirit-grinding consequence
of poverty and infamy&mdash;for a character
for honesty and economy, which God
knows I merited, I was told by this&mdash;why
must I call her woman?&mdash;'that
it would go against her conscience to
recommend a kept mistress.' Tears
started in my eyes, burning tears; for
there are situations in which a wretch<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-109" id="APg_1-109"></a>[<a href="images/v1-109.png">109</a>]</span>
is humbled by the contempt they are
conscious they do not deserve.</p>

<p>"I returned to the metropolis; but
the solitude of a poor lodging was inconceivably
dreary, after the society I
had enjoyed. To be cut off from human
converse, now I had been taught
to relish it, was to wander a ghost
among the living. Besides, I foresaw, to
aggravate the severity of my fate, that
my little pittance would soon melt
away. I endeavoured to obtain needlework;
but, not having been taught early,
and my hands being rendered clumsy
by hard work, I did not sufficiently excel
to be employed by the ready-made
linen shops, when so many women,
better qualified, were suing for it.
The want of a character prevented my
getting a place; for, irksome as servitude
would have been to me, I should<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-110" id="APg_1-110"></a>[<a href="images/v1-110.png">110</a>]</span>
have made another trial, had it been
feasible. Not that I disliked employment,
but the inequality of condition
to which I must have submitted.
I had acquired a taste for literature,
during the five years I had lived with
a literary man, occasionally conversing
with men of the first abilities of the
age; and now to descend to the lowest
vulgarity, was a degree of wretchedness
not to be imagined unfelt. I had
not, it is true, tasted the charms of affection,
but I had been familiar with
the graces of humanity.</p>

<p>"One of the gentlemen, whom I
had frequently dined in company with,
while I was treated like a companion,
met me in the street, and enquired
after my health. I seized the occasion,
and began to describe my situation;
but he was in haste to join, at dinner,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-111" id="APg_1-111"></a>[<a href="images/v1-111.png">111</a>]</span>
a select party of choice spirits; therefore,
without waiting to hear me, he
impatiently put a guinea into my hand,
saying, 'It was a pity such a sensible
woman should be in distress&mdash;he wished
me well from his soul.'</p>

<p>"To another I wrote, stating my case,
and requesting advice. He was an advocate
for unequivocal sincerity; and
had often, in my presence, descanted
on the evils which arise in society from
the despotism of rank and riches.</p>

<p>"In reply, I received a long essay on
the energy of the human mind, with
continual allusions to his own force of
character. He added, 'That the woman
who could write such a letter as I
had sent him, could never be in want
of resources, were she to look into herself,
and exert her powers; misery was
the consequence of indolence, and, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-112" id="APg_1-112"></a>[<a href="images/v1-112.png">112</a>]</span>
to my being shut out from society, it
was the lot of man to submit to certain
privations.'</p>

<p>"How often have I heard," said
Jemima, interrupting her narrative,
"in conversation, and read in books,
that every person willing to work may
find employment? It is the vague assertion,
I believe, of insensible indolence,
when it relates to men; but, with
respect to women, I am sure of its fallacy,
unless they will submit to the
most menial bodily labour; and even
to be employed at hard labour is out of
the reach of many, whose reputation
misfortune or folly has tainted.</p>

<p>"How writers, professing to be friends
to freedom, and the improvement of
morals, can assert that poverty is no
evil, I cannot imagine."</p>

<p>"No more can I," interrupted Ma<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-113" id="APg_1-113"></a>[<a href="images/v1-113.png">113</a>]</span>ria,
"yet they even expatiate on the
peculiar happiness of indigence, though
in what it can consist, excepting in
brutal rest, when a man can barely earn
a subsistence, I cannot imagine. The
mind is necessarily imprisoned in its
own little tenement; and, fully occupied
by keeping it in repair, has not
time to rove abroad for improvement.
The book of knowledge is closely
clasped, against those who must fulfil
their daily task of severe manual labour
or die; and curiosity, rarely excited by
thought or information, seldom moves
on the stagnate lake of ignorance."</p>

<p>"As far as I have been able to observe,"
replied Jemima, "prejudices,
caught up by chance, are obstinately
maintained by the poor, to the exclusion
of improvement; they have not
time to reason or reflect to any extent,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-114" id="APg_1-114"></a>[<a href="images/v1-114.png">114</a>]</span>
or minds sufficiently exercised to adopt
the principles of action, which form
perhaps the only basis of contentment
in every station<a name="AFNanchor_114-A_5" id="AFNanchor_114-A_5"></a><a href="#AFootnote_114-A_5" class="fnanchor">[114-A]</a>."</p>

<hr />

<p>"And independence," said Darnford,
"they are necessarily strangers to,
even the independence of despising their
persecutors. If the poor are happy, or
can be happy, <i>things are very well as they
are</i>. And I cannot conceive on what
principle those writers contend for a
change of system, who support this
opinion. The authors on the other
side of the question are much more
consistent, who grant the fact; yet, insisting
that it is the lot of the majority<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-115" id="APg_1-115"></a>[<a href="images/v1-115.png">115</a>]</span>
to be oppressed in this life, kindly turn
them over to another, to rectify the
false weights and measures of this, as
the only way to justify the dispensations
of Providence. I have not," continued
Darnford, "an opinion more firmly
fixed by observation in my mind, than
that, though riches may fail to produce
proportionate happiness, poverty most
commonly excludes it, by shutting up
all the avenues to improvement."</p>

<p>"And as for the affections," added
Maria, with a sigh, "how gross, and
even tormenting do they become, unless
regulated by an improving mind!
The culture of the heart ever, I believe,
keeps pace with that of the
mind. But pray go on," addressing
Jemima, "though your narrative gives
rise to the most painful reflections on
the present state of society."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-116" id="APg_1-116"></a>[<a href="images/v1-116.png">116</a>]</span>
"Not to trouble you," continued
she, "with a detailed description of all
the painful feelings of unavailing exertion,
I have only to tell you, that at
last I got recommended to wash in a
few families, who did me the favour
to admit me into their houses, without
the most strict enquiry, to wash from
one in the morning till eight at night,
for eighteen or twenty-pence a day.
On the happiness to be enjoyed over a
washing-tub I need not comment; yet
you will allow me to observe, that this
was a wretchedness of situation peculiar
to my sex. A man with half my industry,
and, I may say, abilities, could
have procured a decent livelihood, and
discharged some of the duties which
knit mankind together; whilst I, who
had acquired a taste for the rational, nay,
in honest pride let me assert it, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-117" id="APg_1-117"></a>[<a href="images/v1-117.png">117</a>]</span>
virtuous enjoyments of life, was cast
aside as the filth of society. Condemned
to labour, like a machine, only
to earn bread, and scarcely that, I became
melancholy and desperate.</p>

<p>"I have now to mention a circumstance
which fills me with remorse, and
fear it will entirely deprive me of your
esteem. A tradesman became attached
to me, and visited me frequently,&mdash;and
I at last obtained such a power over
him, that he offered to take me home
to his house.&mdash;Consider, dear madam,
I was famishing: wonder not that I became
a wolf!&mdash;The only reason for not
taking me home immediately, was the
having a girl in the house, with child
by him&mdash;and this girl&mdash;I advised him&mdash;yes,
I did! would I could forget it!&mdash;to
turn out of doors: and one night he
determined to follow my advice, Poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-118" id="APg_1-118"></a>[<a href="images/v1-118.png">118</a>]</span>
wretch! she fell upon her knees, reminded
him that he had promised to
marry her, that her parents were honest!&mdash;What
did it avail?&mdash;She was turned
out.</p>

<p>"She approached her father's door,
in the skirts of London,&mdash;listened at
the shutters,&mdash;but could not knock. A
watchman had observed her go and
return several times&mdash;Poor wretch!&mdash;<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Errata: original reads '['">"</ins> The
remorse Jemima spoke of, seemed
to be stinging her to the soul, as she
proceeded.<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Errata: original reads ']'">"</ins></p>

<p>"She left it, and, approaching a
tub where horses were watered, she
sat down in it, and, with desperate resolution,
remained in that attitude&mdash;till
resolution was no longer necessary!</p>

<p>"I happened that morning to be
going out to wash, anticipating the
moment when I should escape from<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-119" id="APg_1-119"></a>[<a href="images/v1-119.png">119</a>]</span>
such hard labour. I passed by, just as
some men, going to work, drew out
the stiff, cold corpse&mdash;Let me not recal
the horrid moment!&mdash;I recognized
her pale visage; I listened to the tale
told by the spectators, and my heart
did not burst. I thought of my own
state, and wondered how I could be
such a monster!&mdash;I worked hard; and,
returning home, I was attacked by a
fever. I suffered both in body and mind.
I determined not to live with the
wretch. But he did not try me; he
left the neighbourhood. I once more
returned to the wash-tub.</p>

<p>"Still this state, miserable as it was,
admitted of aggravation. Lifting one
day a heavy load, a tub fell against my
shin, and gave me great pain. I did
not pay much attention to the hurt,
till it became a serious wound; being<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-120" id="APg_1-120"></a>[<a href="images/v1-120.png">120</a>]</span>
obliged to work as usual, or starve.
But, finding myself at length unable
to stand for any time, I thought of
getting into an hospital. Hospitals, it
should seem (for they are comfortless
abodes for the sick) were expressly endowed
for the reception of the friendless;
yet I, who had on that plea a
right to assistance, wanted the recommendation
of the rich and respectable,
and was several weeks languishing for admittance;
fees were demanded on entering;
and, what was still more unreasonable,
security for burying me, that expence
not coming into the letter of the
charity. A guinea was the stipulated sum&mdash;I
could as soon have raised a million;
and I was afraid to apply to the parish
for an order, lest they should have
passed me, I knew not whither. The
poor woman at whose house I lodged,
compassionating my state, got me into<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-121" id="APg_1-121"></a>[<a href="images/v1-121.png">121</a>]</span>
the hospital; and the family where I
received the hurt, sent me five shillings,
three and six-pence of which I gave at
my admittance&mdash;I know not for what.</p>

<p>"My leg grew quickly better; but
I was dismissed before my cure was
completed, because I could not afford
to have my linen washed to appear decently,
as the virago of a nurse said,
when the gentlemen (the surgeons)
came. I cannot give you an adequate
idea of the wretchedness of an hospital;
every thing is left to the care of people
intent on gain. The attendants seem
to have lost all feeling of compassion in
the bustling discharge of their offices;
death is so familiar to them, that they
are not anxious to ward it off. Every
thing appeared to be conducted for the
accommodation of the medical men
and their pupils, who came to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-122" id="APg_1-122"></a>[<a href="images/v1-122.png">122</a>]</span>
experiments on the poor, for the benefit
of the rich. One of the physicians,
I must not forget to mention, gave me
half-a-crown, and ordered me some
wine, when I was at the lowest ebb. I
thought of making my case known to
the lady-like matron; but her forbidding
countenance prevented me. She
condescended to look on the patients,
and make general enquiries, two or
three times a week; but the nurses
knew the hour when the visit of ceremony
would commence, and every
thing was as it should be.</p>

<p>"After my dismission, I was more at
a loss than ever for a subsistence, and,
not to weary you with a repetition of
the same unavailing attempts, unable
to stand at the washing-tub, I began to
consider the rich and poor as natural
enemies, and became a thief from prin<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-123" id="APg_1-123"></a>[<a href="images/v1-123.png">123</a>]</span>ciple.
I could not now cease to reason,
but I hated mankind. I despised myself,
yet I justified my conduct. I was
taken, tried, and condemned to six
months' imprisonment in a house of
correction. My soul recoils with horror
from the remembrance of the insults I
had to endure, till, branded with shame,
I was turned loose in the street, pennyless.
I wandered from street to street,
till, exhausted by hunger and fatigue, I
sunk down senseless at a door, where
I had vainly demanded a morsel of
bread. I was sent by the inhabitant to
the work-house, to which he had surlily
bid me go, saying, he 'paid enough
in conscience to the poor,' when, with
parched tongue, I implored his charity.
If those well-meaning people who exclaim
against beggars, were acquainted
with the treatment the poor receive in<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-124" id="APg_1-124"></a>[<a href="images/v1-124.png">124</a>]</span>
many of these wretched asylums, they
would not stifle so easily involuntary
sympathy, by saying that they have all
parishes to go to, or wonder that the
poor dread to enter the gloomy walls.
What are the common run of work-houses,
but prisons, in which many
respectable old people, worn out by
immoderate labour, sink into the grave
in sorrow, to which they are carried
like dogs!"</p>

<p>Alarmed by some indistinct noise,
Jemima rose hastily to listen, and Maria,
turning to Darnford, said, "I have indeed
been shocked beyond expression
when I have met a pauper's funeral. A
coffin carried on the shoulders of three
or four ill-looking wretches, whom the
imagination might easily convert into a
band of assassins, hastening to conceal
the corpse, and quarrelling about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-125" id="APg_1-125"></a>[<a href="images/v1-125.png">125</a>]</span>
prey on their way. I know it is of
little consequence how we are consigned
to the earth; but I am led by
this brutal insensibility, to what even
the animal creation appears forcibly to
feel, to advert to the wretched, deserted
manner in which they died."</p>

<p>"True," rejoined Darnford, "and,
till the rich will give more than a part
of their wealth, till they will give time
and attention to the wants of the distressed,
never let them boast of charity.
Let them open their hearts, and not
their purses, and employ their minds
in the service, if they are really actuated
by humanity; or charitable institutions
will always be the prey of the
lowest order of knaves."</p>

<p>Jemima returning, seemed in haste
to finish her tale. "The overseer
farmed the poor of different parishes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-126" id="APg_1-126"></a>[<a href="images/v1-126.png">126</a>]</span>
and out of the bowels of poverty was
wrung the money with which he purchased
this dwelling, as a private receptacle
for madness. He had been
a keeper at a house of the same description,
and conceived that he could
make money much more readily in his
old occupation. He is a shrewd&mdash;shall
I say it?&mdash;villain. He observed something
resolute in my manner, and offered
to take me with him, and instruct
me how to treat the disturbed minds he
meant to intrust to my care. The
offer of forty pounds a year, and to quit
a workhouse, was not to be despised,
though the condition of shutting my
eyes and hardening my heart was annexed
to it.</p>

<p>"I agreed to accompany him; and
four years have I been attendant on
many wretches, and"&mdash;she lowered<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-127" id="APg_1-127"></a>[<a href="images/v1-127.png">127</a>]</span>
her voice,&mdash;"the witness of many
enormities. In solitude my mind
seemed to recover its force, and many
of the sentiments which I imbibed in
the only tolerable period of my life, returned
with their full force. Still
what should induce me to be the champion
for suffering humanity?&mdash;Who
ever risked any thing for me?&mdash;Who
ever acknowledged me to be a fellow-creature?"&mdash;</p>

<p>Maria took her hand, and Jemima,
more overcome by kindness than she
had ever been by cruelty, hastened out
of the room to conceal her emotions.</p>

<p>Darnford soon after heard his summons,
and, taking leave of him, Maria
promised to gratify his curiosity,
with respect to herself, the first
opportunity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Active</span> as love was in the heart
of Maria, the story she had just heard
made her thoughts take a wider range.
The opening buds of hope closed, as
if they had put forth too early, and the
the happiest day of her life was overcast
by the most melancholy reflections.
Thinking of Jemima's peculiar fate
and her own, she was led to consider
the oppressed state of women, and to
lament that she had given birth to a
daughter. Sleep fled from her eyelids,
while she dwelt on the wretchedness
of unprotected infancy, till sympathy
with Jemima changed to agony,
when it seemed probable that her own<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-129" id="APg_1-129"></a>[<a href="images/v1-129.png">129</a>]</span>
babe might even now be in the very
state she so forcibly described.</p>

<p>Maria thought, and thought again.
Jemima's humanity had rather been
benumbed than killed, by the keen
frost she had to brave at her entrance
into life; an appeal then to her feelings,
on this tender point, surely
would not be fruitless; and Maria began
to anticipate the delight it would
afford her to gain intelligence of her
child. This project was now the only
subject of reflection; and she watched
impatiently for the dawn of day, with
that determinate purpose which generally
insures success.</p>

<p>At the usual hour, Jemima brought
her breakfast, and a tender note from
Darnford. She ran her eye hastily over
it, and her heart calmly hoarded up
the rapture a fresh assurance of affec<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-130" id="APg_1-130"></a>[<a href="images/v1-130.png">130</a>]</span>tion,
affection such as she wished to
inspire, gave her, without diverting her
mind a moment from its design. While
Jemima waited to take away the
breakfast, Maria alluded to the reflections,
that had haunted her during the
night to the exclusion of sleep. She
spoke with energy of Jemima's unmerited
sufferings, and of the fate of a
number of deserted females, placed
within the sweep of a whirlwind, from
which it was next to impossible to
escape. Perceiving the effect her conversation
produced on the countenance
of her guard, she grasped the arm of
Jemima with that irresistible warmth
which defies repulse, exclaiming&mdash;"With
your heart, and such dreadful
experience, can you lend your aid to
deprive my babe of a mother's tenderness,
a mother's care? In the name<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-131" id="APg_1-131"></a>[<a href="images/v1-131.png">131</a>]</span>
of God, assist me to snatch her from
destruction! Let me but give her an
education&mdash;let me but prepare her
body and mind to encounter the ills
which await her sex, and I will teach
her to consider you as her second mother,
and herself as the prop of your
age. Yes, Jemima, look at me&mdash;observe
me closely, and read my very soul;
you merit a better fate;" she held out
her hand with a firm gesture of assurance;
"and I will procure it for you,
as a testimony of my esteem, as well as
of my gratitude."</p>

<p>Jemima had not power to resist this
persuasive torrent; and, owning that
the house in which she was confined,
was situated on the banks of the
Thames, only a few miles from London,
and not on the sea-coast, as Darnford
had supposed, she promised to in<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-132" id="APg_1-132"></a>[<a href="images/v1-132.png">132</a>]</span>vent
some excuse for her absence, and
go herself to trace the situation, and
enquire concerning the health, of this
abandoned daughter. Her manner
implied an intention to do something
more, but she seemed unwilling to
impart her design; and Maria, glad to
have obtained the main point, thought
it best to leave her to the workings of
her own mind; convinced that she had
the power of interesting her still more
in favour of herself and child, by a
simple recital of facts.</p>

<p>In the evening, Jemima informed the
impatient mother, that on the morrow
she should hasten to town before the family
hour of rising, and received all
the information necessary, as a clue to
her search. The "Good night!" Maria
uttered was peculiarly solemn and
affectionate. Glad expectation spar<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-133" id="APg_1-133"></a>[<a href="images/v1-133.png">133</a>]</span>kled
in her eye; and, for the first time
since her detention, she pronounced
the name of her child with pleasureable
fondness; and, with all the garrulity
of a nurse, described her first
smile when she recognized her mother.
Recollecting herself, a still
kinder "Adieu!" with a "God
bless you!"&mdash;that seemed to include
a maternal benediction, dismissed
Jemima.</p>

<p>The dreary solitude of the ensuing
day, lengthened by impatiently dwelling
on the same idea, was intolerably
wearisome. She listened for the sound
of a particular clock, which some directions
of the wind allowed her to
hear distinctly. She marked the shadow
gaining on the wall; and, twilight
thickening into darkness, her breath
seemed oppressed while she anxiously<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-134" id="APg_1-134"></a>[<a href="images/v1-134.png">134</a>]</span>
counted nine.&mdash;The last sound was a
stroke of despair on her heart; for she
expected every moment, without seeing
Jemima, to have her light extinguished
by the savage female who supplied
her place. She was even obliged
to prepare for bed, restless as she was,
not to disoblige her new attendant.
She had been cautioned not to speak
too freely to her; but the caution was
needless, her countenance would still
more emphatically have made her
shrink back. Such was the ferocity of
manner, conspicuous in every word
and gesture of this hag, that Maria was
afraid to enquire, why Jemima, who
had faithfully promised to see her before
her door was shut for the night, came
not?&mdash;and, when the key turned in the
lock, to consign her to a night of suspence,
she felt a degree of anguish<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-135" id="APg_1-135"></a>[<a href="images/v1-135.png">135</a>]</span>
which the circumstances scarcely justified.</p>

<p>Continually on the watch, the shutting
of a door, or the sound of a footstep,
made her start and tremble with
apprehension, something like what she
felt, when, at her entrance, dragged
along the gallery, she began to doubt
whether she were not surrounded by
demons?</p>

<p>Fatigued by an endless rotation of
thought and wild alarms, she looked
like a spectre, when Jemima entered
in the morning; especially as her eyes
darted out of her head, to read in Jemima's
countenance, almost as pallid,
the intelligence she dared not trust her
tongue to demand. Jemima put down
the tea-things, and appeared very busy
in arranging the table. Maria took up
a cup with trembling hand, then for<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-136" id="APg_1-136"></a>[<a href="images/v1-136.png">136</a>]</span>cibly
recovering her fortitude, and restraining
the convulsive movement
which agitated the muscles of her
mouth, she said, "Spare yourself the
pain of preparing me for your information,
I adjure you!&mdash;My child is dead!"
Jemima solemnly answered, "Yes;"
with a look expressive of compassion
and angry emotions. "Leave me,"
added Maria, making a fresh effort to
govern her feelings, and hiding her face
in her handkerchief, to conceal her anguish&mdash;"It
is enough&mdash;I know that my
babe is no more&mdash;I will hear the particulars
when I am"&mdash;<i>calmer</i>, she could not
utter; and Jemima, without importuning
her by idle attempts to console her,
left the room.</p>

<p>Plunged in the deepest melancholy,
she would not admit Darnford's visits;
and such is the force of early associa<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-137" id="APg_1-137"></a>[<a href="images/v1-137.png">137</a>]</span>tions
even on strong minds, that, for
a while, she indulged the superstitious
notion that she was justly punished by
the death of her child, for having for an
instant ceased to regret her loss. Two
or three letters from Darnford, full of
soothing, manly tenderness, only added
poignancy to these accusing emotions;
yet the passionate style in which he expressed,
what he termed the first and
fondest wish of his heart, "that his affection
might make her some amends
for the cruelty and injustice she had endured,"
inspired a sentiment of gratitude
to heaven; and her eyes filled
with delicious tears, when, at the conclusion
of his letter, wishing to supply
the place of her unworthy relations,
whose want of principle he execrated,
he assured her, calling her his dearest
girl, "that it should henceforth be the
business of his life to make her happy."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-138" id="APg_1-138"></a>[<a href="images/v1-138.png">138</a>]</span>
He begged, in a note sent the following
morning, to be permitted to see
her, when his presence would be no intrusion
on her grief; and so earnestly
intreated to be allowed, according to
promise, to beguile the tedious moments
of absence, by dwelling on the
events of her past life, that she sent him
the memoirs which had been written
for her daughter, promising Jemima the
perusal as soon as he returned them.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Addressing</span> these memoirs to
you, my child, uncertain whether I
shall ever have an opportunity of instructing
you, many observations will
probably flow from my heart, which
only a mother&mdash;a mother schooled in
misery, could make.</p>

<p>"The tenderness of a father who knew
the world, might be great; but could it
equal that of a mother&mdash;of a mother,
labouring under a portion of the misery,
which the constitution of society seems
to have entailed on all her kind? It is,

such a mother, who will dare to break

your bosom. From my narrative, my

the counsel, which is meant rather
to exercise than influence your
mind.&mdash;Death may snatch me from you,
before you can weigh my advice, or

with fond anxiety, lead you very early
in life to form your grand principle of
action, to save you from the vain regret
of having, through irresolution, let the
spring-tide of existence pass away, unimproved,
unenjoyed.&mdash;Gain experience&mdash;ah!

shrieks, but I would invite all the gay
warblers of spring to nestle in your
blooming bosom.&mdash;Had I not wasted
years in deliberating, after I ceased to
doubt, how I ought to have acted&mdash;I
might now be useful and happy.&mdash;For
my sake, warned by my example, always
appear what you are, and you
will not pass through existence without
enjoying its genuine blessings, love and
respect.</p>

<p>"Born in one of the most romantic
parts of England, an enthusiastic fondness
for the varying charms of nature
is the first sentiment I recollect; or rather
it was the first consciousness of
pleasure that employed and formed my
imagination.</p>

<p>"My father had been a captain
of a man of war; but, disgusted with
the service, on account of the pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-142" id="APg_1-142"></a>[<a href="images/v1-142.png">142</a>]</span>ferment
of men whose chief merit was
their family connections or borough
interest, he retired into the country;
and, not knowing what to do with
himself&mdash;married. In his family, to
regain his lost consequence, he determined
to keep up the same passive obedience,
as in the vessels in which he had
commanded. His orders were not to be
disputed; and the whole house was expected
to fly, at the word of command,
as if to man the shrouds, or mount aloft
in an elemental strife, big with life or
death. He was to be instantaneously
obeyed, especially by my mother, whom
he very benevolently married for love;
but took care to remind her of the obligation,
when she dared, in the slightest
instance, to question his absolute authority.
My eldest brother, it is true, as
he grew up, was treated with more re<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-143" id="APg_1-143"></a>[<a href="images/v1-143.png">143</a>]</span>spect
by my father; and became in due
form the deputy-tyrant of the house.
The representative of my father, a being
privileged by nature&mdash;a boy, and
the darling of my mother, he did not
fail to act like an heir apparent. Such
indeed was my mother's extravagant
partiality, that, in comparison with her
affection for him, she might be said not
to love the rest of her children. Yet
none of the children seemed to have so
little affection for her. Extreme indulgence
had rendered him so selfish,
that he only thought of himself; and
from tormenting insects and animals, he
became the despot of his brothers, and
still more of his sisters.</p>

<p>"It is perhaps difficult to give you an
idea of the petty cares which obscured
the morning of my life; continual restraint
in the most trivial matters; un<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-144" id="APg_1-144"></a>[<a href="images/v1-144.png">144</a>]</span>conditional
submission to orders, which,
as a mere child, I soon discovered to be
unreasonable, because inconsistent and
contradictory. Thus are we destined
to experience a mixture of bitterness,
with the recollection of our most innocent
enjoyments.</p>

<p>"The circumstances which, during
my childhood, occurred to fashion my
mind, were various; yet, as it would
probably afford me more pleasure to
revive the fading remembrance of new-born
delight, than you, my child, could
feel in the perusal, I will not entice
you to stray with me into the verdant
meadow, to search for the flowers that
youthful hopes scatter in every path;
though, as I write, I almost scent the
fresh green of spring&mdash;of that spring
which never returns!</p>

<p>"I had two sisters, and one brother,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-145" id="APg_1-145"></a>[<a href="images/v1-145.png">145</a>]</span>
younger than myself; my brother Robert
was two years older, and might
truly be termed the idol of his parents,
and the torment of the rest of the family.
Such indeed is the force of prejudice,
that what was called spirit and
wit in him, was cruelly repressed as
forwardness in me.</p>

<p>"My mother had an indolence of
character, which prevented her from
paying much attention to our education.
But the healthy breeze of a
neighbouring heath, on which we
bounded at pleasure, volatilized the
humours that improper food might
have generated. And to enjoy open
air and freedom, was paradise, after
the unnatural restraint of our fire-side,
where we were often obliged to sit
three or four hours together, without
daring to utter a word, when my fa<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-146" id="APg_1-146"></a>[<a href="images/v1-146.png">146</a>]</span>ther
was out of humour, from want of
employment, or of a variety of boisterous
amusement. I had however one
advantage, an instructor, the brother
of my father, who, intended for the
church, had of course received a
liberal education. But, becoming attached
to a young lady of great beauty
and large fortune, and acquiring in the
world some opinions not consonant
with the profession for which he was
designed, he accepted, with the most
sanguine expectations of success, the
offer of a nobleman to accompany him
to India, as his confidential secretary.</p>

<p>"A correspondence was regularly
kept up with the object of his affection;
and the intricacies of business, peculiarly
wearisome to a man of a romantic
turn of mind, contributed, with a forced
absence, to increase his attachment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-147" id="APg_1-147"></a>[<a href="images/v1-147.png">147</a>]</span>
Every other passion was lost in this
master-one, and only served to swell the
torrent. Her relations, such were his
waking dreams, who had despised him,
would court in their turn his alliance,
and all the blandishments of taste would
grace the triumph of love.&mdash;While he
basked in the warm sunshine of love,
friendship also promised to shed its
dewy freshness; for a friend, whom he
loved next to his mistress, was the confident,
who forwarded the letters from
one to the other, to elude the observation
of prying relations. A friend false
in similar circumstances, is, my dearest
girl, an old tale; yet, let not this example,
or the frigid caution of cold-blooded
moralists, make you endeavour
to stifle hopes, which are the buds that
naturally unfold themselves during the
spring of life! Whilst your own heart<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-148" id="APg_1-148"></a>[<a href="images/v1-148.png">148</a>]</span>
is sincere, always expect to meet one
glowing with the same sentiments; for
to fly from pleasure, is not to avoid
pain!</p>

<p>"My uncle realized, by good luck,
rather than management, a handsome
fortune; and returning on the wings of
love, lost in the most enchanting reveries,
to England, to share it with his
mistress and his friend, he found them&mdash;united.</p>

<p>"There were some circumstances, not
necessary for me to recite, which aggravated
the guilt of the friend beyond measure,
and the deception, that had been carried
on to the last moment, was so base,
it produced the most violent effect on
my uncle's health and spirits. His native
country, the world! lately a garden of
blooming sweets, blasted by treachery,
seemed changed into a parched desert,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-149" id="APg_1-149"></a>[<a href="images/v1-149.png">149</a>]</span>
the abode of hissing serpents. Disappointment
rankled in his heart; and,
brooding over his wrongs, he was attacked
by a raging fever, followed by
a derangement of mind, which only
gave place to habitual melancholy, as
he recovered more strength of body.</p>

<p>"Declaring an intention never to
marry, his relations were ever clustering
about him, paying the grossest adulation
to a man, who, disgusted with
mankind, received them with scorn, or
bitter sarcasms. Something in my
countenance pleased him, when I began
to prattle. Since his return, he appeared
dead to affection; but I soon,
by showing him innocent fondness, became
a favourite; and endeavouring
to enlarge and strengthen my mind, I
grew dear to him in proportion as I imbibed
his sentiments. He had a forcible<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-150" id="APg_1-150"></a>[<a href="images/v1-150.png">150</a>]</span>
manner of speaking, rendered more
so by a certain impressive wildness of
look and gesture, calculated to engage
the attention of a young and ardent
mind. It is not then surprising that I
quickly adopted his opinions in preference,
and reverenced him as one of
a superior order of beings. He inculcated,
with great warmth, self-respect,
and a lofty consciousness of acting
right, independent of the censure or
applause of the world; nay, he almost
taught me to brave, and even despise
its censure, when convinced of the rectitude
of my own intentions.</p>

<p>"Endeavouring to prove to me that
nothing which deserved the name of
love or friendship, existed in the world,
he drew such animated pictures of his
own feelings, rendered permanent by
disappointment, as imprinted the sen<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-151" id="APg_1-151"></a>[<a href="images/v1-151.png">151</a>]</span>timents
strongly on my heart, and animated
my imagination. These remarks
are necessary to elucidate some peculiarities
in my character, which by the
world are indefinitely termed romantic.</p>

<p>"My uncle's increasing affection led
him to visit me often. Still, unable to
rest in any place, he did not remain
long in the country to soften domestic
tyranny; but he brought me books, for
which I had a passion, and they conspired
with his conversation, to make
me form an ideal picture of life. I shall
pass over the tyranny of my father,
much as I suffered from it; but it is
necessary to notice, that it undermined
my mother's health; and that
her temper, continually irritated by
domestic bickering, became intolerably
peevish.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-152" id="APg_1-152"></a>[<a href="images/v1-152.png">152</a>]</span>
"My eldest brother was articled to a
neighbouring attorney, the shrewdest,
and, I may add, the most unprincipled
man in that part of the country. As
my brother generally came home every
Saturday, to astonish my mother by
exhibiting his attainments, he gradually
assumed a right of directing the
whole family, not excepting my father.
He seemed to take a peculiar pleasure
in tormenting and humbling me; and
if I ever ventured to complain of this
treatment to either my father or mother,
I was rudely rebuffed for presuming
to judge of the conduct of my eldest
brother.</p>

<p>"About this period a merchant's
family came to settle in our neighbourhood.
A mansion-house in the village,
lately purchased, had been preparing
the whole spring, and the sight of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-153" id="APg_1-153"></a>[<a href="images/v1-153.png">153</a>]</span>
costly furniture, sent from London, had
excited my mother's envy, and roused
my father's pride. My sensations were
very different, and all of a pleasurable
kind. I longed to see new characters,
to break the tedious monotony of my
life; and to find a friend, such as fancy
had pourtrayed. I cannot then describe
the emotion I felt, the Sunday they
made their appearance at church. My
eyes were rivetted on the pillar round
which I expected first to catch a glimpse
of them, and darted forth to meet a
servant who hastily preceded a group
of ladies, whose white robes and waving
plumes, seemed to stream along the
gloomy aisle, diffusing the light, by
which I contemplated their figures.</p>

<p>"We visited them in form; and I
quickly selected the eldest daughter for
my friend. The second son, George,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-154" id="APg_1-154"></a>[<a href="images/v1-154.png">154</a>]</span>
paid me particular attention, and finding
his attainments and manners superior
to those of the young men of the
village, I began to imagine him superior
to the rest of mankind. Had my home
been more comfortable, or my previous
acquaintance more numerous, I should
not probably have been so eager to
open my heart to new affections.</p>

<p>"Mr. Venables, the merchant, had
acquired a large fortune by unremitting
attention to business; but his health declining
rapidly, he was obliged to retire,
before his son, George, had acquired
sufficient experience, to enable
him to conduct their affairs on the same
prudential plan, his father had invariably
pursued. Indeed, he had laboured
to throw off his authority,
having despised his narrow plans and
cautious speculation. The eldest son<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-155" id="APg_1-155"></a>[<a href="images/v1-155.png">155</a>]</span>
could not be prevailed on to enter the
firm; and, to oblige his wife, and have
peace in the house, Mr. Venables had
purchased a commission for him in the
guards.</p>

<p>"I am now alluding to circumstances
which came to my knowledge long
after; but it is necessary, my dearest
child, that you should know the character
of your father, to prevent your
despising your mother; the only parent
inclined to discharge a parent's duty.
In London, George had acquired habits
of libertinism, which he carefully concealed
from his father and his commercial
connections. The mask he
wore, was so complete a covering of
his real visage, that the praise his father
lavished on his conduct, and, poor
mistaken man! on his principles, contrasted
with his brother's, rendered the<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-156" id="APg_1-156"></a>[<a href="images/v1-156.png">156</a>]</span>
notice he took of me peculiarly flattering.
Without any fixed design, as I
am now convinced, he continued to
single me out at the dance, press my
hand at parting, and utter expressions
of unmeaning passion, to which I gave
a meaning naturally suggested by the
romantic turn of my thoughts. His
stay in the country was short; his manners
did not entirely please me; but,
when he left us, the colouring of my
picture became more vivid&mdash;Whither
did not my imagination lead me? In
short, I fancied myself in love&mdash;in love
with the disinterestedness, fortitude,
generosity, dignity, and humanity, with
which I had invested the hero I dubbed.
A circumstance which soon after
occurred, rendered all these virtues
palpable. [The incident is perhaps
worth relating on other accounts, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-157" id="APg_1-157"></a>[<a href="images/v1-157.png">157</a>]</span>
therefore I shall describe it distinctly.]</p>

<p>"I had a great affection for my nurse,
old Mary, for whom I used often to
work, to spare her eyes. Mary had a
younger sister, married to a sailor, while
she was suckling me; for my mother
only suckled my eldest brother, which
might be the cause of her extraordinary
partiality. Peggy, Mary's sister, lived
with her, till her husband, becoming a
mate in a West-India trader, got a little
before-hand in the world. He
wrote to his wife from the first port in
the Channel, after his most successful
voyage, to request her to come to
London to meet him; he even wished
her to determine on living there for the
future, to save him the trouble of coming
to her the moment he came on
shore; and to turn a penny by keeping<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-158" id="APg_1-158"></a>[<a href="images/v1-158.png">158</a>]</span>
a green-stall. It was too much to set out
on a journey the moment he had finished
a voyage, and fifty miles by land, was
worse than a thousand leagues by sea.</p>

<p>"She packed up her alls, and came to
London&mdash;but did not meet honest Daniel.
A common misfortune prevented
her, and the poor are bound to suffer
for the good of their country&mdash;he was
pressed in the river&mdash;and never came on
shore.</p>

<p>"Peggy was miserable in London,
not knowing, as she said, 'the face of
any living soul.' Besides, her imagination
had been employed, anticipating
a month or six weeks' happiness with
her husband. Daniel was to have gone
with her to Sadler's Wells, and Westminster
Abbey, and to many sights,
which he knew she never heard of in
the country. Peggy too was thrifty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-159" id="APg_1-159"></a>[<a href="images/v1-159.png">159</a>]</span>
and how could she manage to put his
plan in execution alone? He had acquaintance;
but she did not know the
very name of their places of abode.
His letters were made up of&mdash;How do
you does, and God bless yous,&mdash;information
was reserved for the hour of
meeting.</p>

<p>"She too had her portion of information,
near at heart. Molly and Jacky
were grown such little darlings, she
was almost angry that daddy did not
see their tricks. She had not half the
pleasure she should have had from their
prattle, could she have recounted to
him each night the pretty speeches of
the day. Some stories, however, were
stored up&mdash;and Jacky could say papa
with such a sweet voice, it must delight
his heart. Yet when she came, and
found no Daniel to greet her, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-160" id="APg_1-160"></a>[<a href="images/v1-160.png">160</a>]</span>
Jacky called papa, she wept, bidding
'God bless his innocent soul, that
did not know what sorrow was.'&mdash;But
more sorrow was in store for Peggy,
innocent as she was.&mdash;Daniel was killed
in the first engagement, and then
the <i>papa</i> was agony, sounding to the
heart.</p>

<p>"She had lived sparingly on his wages,
while there was any hope of his return;
but, that gone, she returned with a
breaking heart to the country, to a
little market town, nearly three miles
from our village. She did not like to
go to service, to be snubbed about,
after being her own mistress. To put
her children out to nurse was impossible:
how far would her wages go? and
to send them to her husband's parish, a
distant one, was to lose her husband
twice over.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-161" id="APg_1-161"></a>[<a href="images/v1-161.png">161</a>]</span>
"I had heard all from Mary, and
made my uncle furnish a little cottage
for her, to enable her to sell&mdash;so sacred
was poor Daniel's advice, now he was
dead and gone&mdash;a little fruit, toys and
cakes. The minding of the shop did
not require her whole time, nor even
the keeping her children clean, and
she loved to see them clean; so she took
in washing, and altogether made a shift
to earn bread for her children, still
weeping for Daniel, when Jacky's arch
looks made her think of his father.&mdash;It
was pleasant to work for her children.&mdash;'Yes;
from morning till night,
could she have had a kiss from their
father, God rest his soul! Yes; had
it <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'plased'">pleased</ins> Providence to have let him
come back without a leg or an arm, it
would have been the same thing to her&mdash;for
she did not love him because he<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-162" id="APg_1-162"></a>[<a href="images/v1-162.png">162</a>]</span>
maintained them&mdash;no; she had hands
of her own.'</p>

<p>"The country people were honest,
and Peggy left her linen out to dry
very late. A recruiting party, as she
supposed, passing through, made free
with a large wash; for it was all swept
away, including her own and her children's
little stock.</p>

<p>"This was a dreadful blow; two dozen
of shirts, stocks and handkerchiefs.
She gave the money which she
had laid by for half a year's rent, and
promised to pay two shillings a week
till all was cleared; so she did not lose
her employment. This two shillings a
week, and the buying a few necessaries
for the children, drove her so hard,
that she had not a penny to pay her rent
with, when a twelvemonth's became
due.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-163" id="APg_1-163"></a>[<a href="images/v1-163.png">163</a>]</span>
"She was now with Mary, and had
just told her tale, which Mary instantly
repeated&mdash;it was intended for my
ear. Many houses in this town, producing
a borough-interest, were included
in the estate purchased by Mr.
Venables, and the attorney with whom
my brother lived, was appointed his
agent, to collect and raise the rents.</p>

<p>"He demanded Peggy's, and, in
spite of her intreaties, her poor goods
had been seized and sold. So that she
had not, and what was worse her children,
'for she had known sorrow
enough,' a bed to lie on. She knew
that I was good-natured&mdash;right charitable,
yet not liking to ask for more
than needs must, she scorned to petition
while people could any how be
made to wait. But now, should she
be turned out of doors, she must ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-164" id="APg_1-164"></a>[<a href="images/v1-164.png">164</a>]</span>pect
nothing less than to lose all her
customers, and then she must beg or
starve&mdash;and what would become of her
children?&mdash;'had Daniel not been
pressed&mdash;but God knows best&mdash;all this
could not have happened.'</p>

<p>"I had two mattrasses on my bed;
what did I want with two, when
such a worthy creature must lie on the
ground? My mother would be angry,
but I could conceal it till my uncle
came down; and then I would tell him
all the whole truth, and if he absolved
me, heaven would.</p>

<p>"I begged the house-maid to come
up stairs with me (servants always feel
for the distresses of poverty, and so
would the rich if they knew what it
was). She assisted me to tie up the
mattrass; I discovering, at the same
time, that one blanket would serve me<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-165" id="APg_1-165"></a>[<a href="images/v1-165.png">165</a>]</span>
till winter, could I persuade my sister,
who slept with me, to keep my secret.
She entering in the midst of the package,
I gave her some new feathers, to
silence her. We got the mattrass
down the back stairs, unperceived,
and I helped to carry it, taking with
me all the money I had, and what I
could borrow from my sister.</p>

<p>"When I got to the cottage, Peggy
declared that she would not take what
I had brought secretly; but, when,
with all the eager eloquence inspired
by a decided purpose, I grasped her
hand with weeping eyes, assuring her
that my uncle would screen me from
blame, when he was once more in the
country, describing, at the same time,
what she would suffer in parting with
her children, after keeping them so
long from being thrown on the parish,
she reluctantly consented.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-166" id="APg_1-166"></a>[<a href="images/v1-166.png">166</a>]</span>
"My project of usefulness ended not
here; I determined to speak to the
attorney; he frequently paid me compliments.
His character did not intimidate
me; but, imagining that Peggy
must be mistaken, and that no man
could turn a deaf ear to such a tale of
complicated distress, I determined to
walk to the town with Mary the next
morning, and request him to wait for
the rent, and keep my secret, till my
uncle's return.</p>

<p>"My repose was sweet; and, waking
with the first dawn of day, I bounded
to Mary's cottage. What charms do
not a light heart spread over nature!
Every bird that twittered in a bush,
every flower that enlivened the hedge,
seemed placed there to awaken me to
rapture&mdash;yes; to rapture. The present
moment was full fraught with happi<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-167" id="APg_1-167"></a>[<a href="images/v1-167.png">167</a>]</span>ness;
and on futurity I bestowed not a
thought, excepting to anticipate my
success with the attorney.</p>

<p>"This man of the world, with rosy
face and simpering features, received
me politely, nay kindly; listened with
complacency to my remonstrances,
though he scarcely heeded Mary's tears.
I did not then suspect, that my eloquence
was in my complexion, the
blush of seventeen, or that, in a world
where humanity to women is the characteristic
of advancing civilization, the
beauty of a young girl was so much
more interesting than the distress of an
old one. Pressing my hand, he promised
to let Peggy remain in the house
as long as I wished.&mdash;I more than returned
the pressure&mdash;I was so grateful
and so happy. Emboldened by my innocent
warmth, he then kissed me<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-168" id="APg_1-168"></a>[<a href="images/v1-168.png">168</a>]</span>&mdash;and
I did not draw back&mdash;I took it for
a kiss of charity.</p>

<p>"Gay as a lark, I went to dine at Mr.
Venables'. I had previously obtained
five shillings from my father, towards
re-clothing the poor children of my
care, and prevailed on my mother to
take one of the girls into the house, whom
I determined to teach to work and read.</p>

<p>"After dinner, when the younger part
of the circle retired to the music room,
I recounted with energy my tale; that
is, I mentioned Peggy's distress, without
hinting at the steps I had taken to
relieve her. Miss Venables gave me
half-a-crown; the heir five shillings;
but George sat unmoved. I was cruelly
distressed by the disappointment&mdash;I
scarcely could remain on my chair;
and, could I have got out of the room
unperceived, I should have flown home,
as if to run away from myself. After<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-169" id="APg_1-169"></a>[<a href="images/v1-169.png">169</a>]</span>
several vain attempts to rise, I leaned
my head against the marble chimney-piece,
and gazing on the evergreens
that filled the fire-place, moralized on
the vanity of human expectations; regardless
of the company. I was roused
by a gentle tap on my shoulder from
behind Charlotte's chair. I turned
my head, and George slid a guinea into
my hand, putting his finger to his
mouth, to enjoin me silence.</p>

<p>"What a revolution took place, not
only in my train of thoughts, but feelings!
I trembled with emotion&mdash;now,
indeed, I was in love. Such delicacy
too, to enhance his benevolence! I felt
in my pocket every five minutes, only
to feel the guinea; and its magic touch
invested my hero with more than mortal
beauty. My fancy had found a basis
to erect its model of perfection on;<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-170" id="APg_1-170"></a>[<a href="images/v1-170.png">170</a>]</span>
and quickly went to work, with all the
happy credulity of youth, to consider
that heart as devoted to virtue, which
had only obeyed a virtuous impulse.
The bitter experience was yet to come,
that has taught me how very distinct
are the principles of virtue, from the
casual feelings from which they germinate.</p>

<h2><a name="ACHAP_VIII" id="ACHAP_VIII"></a>CHAP. VIII.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I have</span> perhaps dwelt too long on
a circumstance, which is only of importance
as it marks the progress of a
deception that has been so fatal to my
peace; and introduces to your notice a
poor girl, whom, intending to serve, I led
to ruin. Still it is probable that I was
not entirely the victim of mistake; and
that your father, gradually fashioned
by the world, did not quickly become
what I hesitate to call him&mdash;out of
respect to my daughter.</p>

<p>"But, to hasten to the more busy
scenes of my life. Mr. Venables and
my mother died the same summer;
and, wholly engrossed by my attention
to her, I thought of little else.
The neglect of her darling, my brother
Robert, had a violent effect on<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-172" id="APg_1-172"></a>[<a href="images/v1-172.png">172</a>]</span>
her weakened mind; for, though boys
may be reckoned the pillars of the
house without doors, girls are often the
only comfort within. They but too frequently
waste their health and spirits
attending a dying parent, who leaves
them in comparative poverty. After
closing, with filial piety, a father's
eyes, they are chased from the paternal
roof, to make room for the first-born,
the son, who is to carry the
empty family-name down to posterity;
though, occupied with his own pleasures,
he scarcely thought of discharging,
in the decline of his parent's life,
the debt contracted in his childhood.
My mother's conduct led me to make
these reflections. Great as was the fatigue
I endured, and the affection my
unceasing solicitude evinced, of which
my mother seemed perfectly sensible,
still, when my brother, whom I could<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-173" id="APg_1-173"></a>[<a href="images/v1-173.png">173</a>]</span>
hardly persuade to remain a quarter of
an hour in her chamber, was with her
alone, a short time before her death,
she gave him a little hoard, which she
had been some years accumulating.</p>

<p>"During my mother's illness, I was
obliged to manage my father's temper,
who, from the lingering nature of her
malady, began to imagine that it was
merely fancy. At this period, an artful
kind of upper servant attracted my
father's attention, and the neighbours
made many remarks on the finery, not
honestly got, exhibited at evening service.
But I was too much occupied
with my mother to observe any change
in her dress or behaviour, or to listen to
the whisper of scandal.</p>

<p>"I shall not dwell on the death-bed
scene, lively as is the remembrance,
or on the emotion produced by the last<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-174" id="APg_1-174"></a>[<a href="images/v1-174.png">174</a>]</span>
grasp of my mother's cold hand; when
blessing me, she added, 'A little patience,
and all will be over!' Ah!
my child, how often have those words
rung mournfully in my ears&mdash;and I
have exclaimed&mdash;'A little more patience,
and I too shall be at rest!'</p>

<p>"My father was violently affected
by her death, recollected instances of
his unkindness, and wept like a child.</p>

<p>"My mother had solemnly recommended
my sisters to my care, and bid
me be a mother to them. They, indeed,
became more dear to me as they
became more forlorn; for, during my
mother's illness, I discovered the ruined
state of my father's circumstances,
and that he had only been able to keep
up appearances, by the sums which he
borrowed of my uncle.</p>

<p>"My father's grief, and consequent<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-175" id="APg_1-175"></a>[<a href="images/v1-175.png">175</a>]</span>
tenderness to his children, quickly
abated, the house grew still more
gloomy or riotous; and my refuge
from care was again at Mr. Venables';
the young 'squire having taken his father's
place, and allowing, for the present,
his sister to preside at his table.
George, though dissatisfied with his
portion of the fortune, which had till
lately been all in trade, visited the family
as usual. He was now full of speculations
in trade, and his brow became
clouded by care. He seemed to relax
in his attention to me, when the presence
of my uncle gave a new turn to
his behaviour. I was too unsuspecting,
too disinterested, to trace these changes
to their source.</p>

<p>My home every day became more
and more disagreeable to me; my liberty
was unnecessarily abridged, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-176" id="APg_1-176"></a>[<a href="images/v1-176.png">176</a>]</span>
my books, on the pretext that they made
me idle, taken from me. My father's
mistress was with child, and he, doating
on her, allowed or overlooked her
vulgar manner of tyrannizing over us.
I was indignant, especially when I saw
her endeavouring to attract, shall I
say seduce? my younger brother. By
allowing women but one way of rising
in the world, the fostering the libertinism
of men, society makes monsters
of them, and then their ignoble
vices are brought forward as a proof of
inferiority of intellect.</p>

<p>The wearisomeness of my situation
can scarcely be described. Though my
life had not passed in the most even tenour
with my mother, it was paradise
to that I was destined to endure with
my father's mistress, jealous of her illegitimate
authority. My father's former<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-177" id="APg_1-177"></a>[<a href="images/v1-177.png">177</a>]</span>
occasional tenderness, in spite of his
violence of temper, had been soothing
to me; but now he only met me with
reproofs or portentous frowns. The
house-keeper, as she was now termed,
was the vulgar despot of the family;
and assuming the new character of a
fine lady, she could never forgive the
contempt which was sometimes visible
in my countenance, when she uttered
with pomposity her bad English, or
affected to be well bred.</p>

<p>To my uncle I ventured to open my
heart; and he, with his wonted benevolence,
began to consider in what
manner he could extricate me out of
my present irksome situation. In spite
of his own disappointment, or, most
probably, actuated by the feelings that
had been petrified, not cooled, in all
their sanguine fervour, like a boiling
torrent of lava suddenly dashing into<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-178" id="APg_1-178"></a>[<a href="images/v1-178.png">178</a>]</span>
the sea, he thought a marriage of mutual
inclination (would envious stars
permit it) the only chance for happiness
in this disastrous world. George
Venables had the reputation of being
attentive to business, and my father's
example gave great weight to this circumstance;
for habits of order in business
would, he conceived, extend to
the regulation of the affections in domestic
life. George seldom spoke in
my uncle's company, except to utter a
short, judicious question, or to make a
pertinent remark, with all due deference
to his superior judgment; so that
my uncle seldom left his company without
observing, that the young man had
more in him than people supposed.</p>

<p>In this opinion he was not singular;
yet, believe me, and I am not swayed
by resentment, these speeches so justly<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-179" id="APg_1-179"></a>[<a href="images/v1-179.png">179</a>]</span>
poized, this silent deference, when the
animal spirits of other young people
were throwing off youthful ebullitions,
were not the effect of thought or humility,
but sheer barrenness of mind,
and want of imagination. A colt of
mettle will curvet and shew his paces.
Yes; my dear girl, these prudent
young men want all the fire necessary
to ferment their faculties, and are characterized
as wise, only because they
are not foolish. It is true, that George
was by no means so great a favourite
of mine as during the first year of our
acquaintance; still, as he often coincided
in opinion with me, and echoed
my sentiments; and having myself no
other attachment, I heard with pleasure
my uncle's proposal; but thought
more of obtaining my freedom, than
of my lover. But, when George, seem<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-180" id="APg_1-180"></a>[<a href="images/v1-180.png">180</a>]</span>ingly
anxious for my happiness, pressed
me to quit my present painful situation,
my heart swelled with gratitude&mdash;I
knew not that my uncle had promised
him five thousand pounds.</p>

<p>Had this truly generous man mentioned
his intention to me, I should have insisted
on a thousand pounds being settled
on each of my sisters; George would
have contested; I should have seen his
selfish soul; and&mdash;gracious God! have
been spared the misery of discovering,
when too late, that I was united to a
heartless, unprincipled wretch. All
my schemes of usefulness would not
then have been blasted. The tenderness
of my heart would not have heated
my imagination with visions of the
ineffable delight of happy love; nor
would the sweet duty of a mother have
been so cruelly interrupted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-181" id="APg_1-181"></a>[<a href="images/v1-181.png">181</a>]</span>
But I must not suffer the fortitude
I have so hardly acquired, to be undermined
by unavailing regret. Let me
hasten forward to describe the turbid
stream in which I had to wade&mdash;but
let me exultingly declare that it is
passed&mdash;my soul holds fellowship with
him no more. He cut the Gordian
knot, which my principles, mistaken
ones, respected; he dissolved the tie, the
fetters rather, that ate into my very
vitals&mdash;and I should rejoice, conscious
that my mind is freed, though confined
in hell itself; the only place that even
fancy can imagine more dreadful than
my present abode.</p>

<p>These varying emotions will not allow
me to proceed. I heave sigh after
sigh; yet my heart is still oppressed.
For what am I reserved? Why was I not
born a man, or why was I born at all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> public are here pre&#383;ented with
the la&#383;t literary attempt of an author,
who&#383;e fame has been uncommonly exten&#383;ive,
and who&#383;e talents have probably
been mo&#383;t admired, by the per&#383;ons
by whom talents are e&#383;timated
with the greate&#383;t accuracy and di&#383;crimination.
There are few, to whom
her writings could in any ca&#383;e have<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-viii_S" id="APg_1-viii_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-viii.png">viii</a>]</span>
given plea&#383;ure, that would have wi&#383;hed
that this fragment &#383;hould have been
&#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ed, becau&#383;e it is a fragment.
There is a &#383;entiment, very dear to minds
of ta&#383;te and imagination, that finds a
melancholy delight in contemplating
the&#383;e unfini&#383;hed productions of genius,
the&#383;e &#383;ketches of what, if they had
been filled up in a manner adequate to
the writer's conception, would perhaps
have given a new impul&#383;e to the
manners of a world.</p>

<p>The purpo&#383;e and &#383;tructure of the
following work, had long formed a
favourite &#383;ubject of meditation with
its author, and &#383;he judged them capable
of producing an important effect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-ix_S" id="APg_1-ix_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-ix.png">ix</a>]</span>
The compo&#383;ition had been in progre&#383;s
for a period of twelve months. She
was anxious to do ju&#383;tice to her conception,
and recommenced and revi&#383;ed
the manu&#383;cript &#383;everal different times.
So much of it as is here given to the
public, &#383;he was far from con&#383;idering
as fini&#383;hed, and, in a letter to a friend
directly written on this &#383;ubject, &#383;he
&#383;ays, "I am perfectly aware that &#383;ome of
the incidents ought to be tran&#383;po&#383;ed,
and heightened by more harmonious
&#383;hading; and I wi&#383;hed in &#383;ome degree
to avail my&#383;elf of critici&#383;m, before I
began to adju&#383;t my events into a &#383;tory,
the outline of which I had &#383;ketched in<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-x_S" id="APg_1-x_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-x.png">x</a>]</span>
my mind<a name="AFNanchor_X-A_1_S" id="AFNanchor_X-A_1_S"></a><a href="#AFootnote_X-A_1_S" class="fnanchor">[x-A]</a>." The only friends to whom
the author communicated her manu&#383;cript,
were Mr. Dy&#383;on, the tran&#383;lator
of the Sorcerer, and the pre&#383;ent editor;
and it was impo&#383;&#383;ible for the mo&#383;t inexperienced
author to di&#383;play a &#383;tronger
de&#383;ire of profiting by the cen&#383;ures and
&#383;entiments that might be &#383;ugge&#383;ted<a name="AFNanchor_X-B_2_S" id="AFNanchor_X-B_2_S"></a><a href="#AFootnote_X-B_2_S" class="fnanchor">[x-B]</a>.</p>

<p>In revi&#383;ing the&#383;e &#383;heets for the pre&#383;s,
it was nece&#383;&#383;ary for the editor, in &#383;ome
places, to connect the more fini&#383;hed<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-xi_S" id="APg_1-xi_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-xi.png">xi</a>]</span>
parts with the pages of an older copy,
and a line or two in addition &#383;ometimes
appeared requi&#383;ite for that purpo&#383;e.
Wherever &#383;uch a liberty has been
taken, the additional phra&#383;es will be
found inclo&#383;ed in brackets; it being
the editor's mo&#383;t earne&#383;t de&#383;ire, to
intrude nothing of him&#383;elf into the
work, but to give to the public the
words, as well as ideas, of the real
author.</p>

<p>What follows in the en&#383;uing pages,
is not a preface regularly drawn out
by the author, but merely hints for a
preface, which, though never filled up
in the manner the writer intended,
appeared to be worth pre&#383;erving.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Wrongs of Woman, like the
wrongs of the oppre&#383;&#383;ed part of mankind,
may be deemed nece&#383;&#383;ary by
their oppre&#383;&#383;ors: but &#383;urely there are
a few, who will dare to advance before
the improvement of the age, and
grant that my &#383;ketches are not the
abortion of a di&#383;tempered fancy, or
the &#383;trong delineations of a wounded
heart.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-xiv_S" id="APg_1-xiv_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-xiv.png">xiv</a>]</span>In writing this novel, I have rather
endeavoured to pourtray pa&#383;&#383;ions than
manners.</p>

<p>In many in&#383;tances I could have made
the incidents more dramatic, would I
have &#383;acrificed my main object, the
de&#383;ire of exhibiting the mi&#383;ery and
oppre&#383;&#383;ion, peculiar to women, that
ari&#383;e out of the partial laws and cu&#383;toms
of &#383;ociety.</p>

<p>In the invention of the &#383;tory, this
view re&#383;trained my fancy; and the
hi&#383;tory ought rather to be con&#383;idered,
as of woman, than of an individual.</p>

<p>The &#383;entiments I have embodied.</p>

<p>In many works of this &#383;pecies, the
hero is allowed to be mortal, and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-xv_S" id="APg_1-xv_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-xv.png">xv</a>]</span>
become wi&#383;e and virtuous as well as
happy, by a train of events and circum&#383;tances.
The heroines, on the
contrary, are to be born immaculate;
and to act like godde&#383;&#383;es of wi&#383;dom, ju&#383;t
come forth highly fini&#383;hed Minervas
from the head of Jove.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>[The following is an extract of a
letter from the author to a friend, to
whom &#383;he communicated her manu&#383;cript.]</p>

<hr />

<p>For my part, I cannot &#383;uppo&#383;e any
&#383;ituation more di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;ing, than for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-xvi_S" id="APg_1-xvi_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-xvi.png">xvi</a>]</span>
woman of &#383;en&#383;ibility, with an improving
mind, to be bound to &#383;uch a man
as I have de&#383;cribed for life; obliged
to renounce all the humanizing affections,
and to avoid cultivating her
ta&#383;te, le&#383;t her perception of grace and
refinement of &#383;entiment, &#383;hould &#383;harpen
to agony the pangs of di&#383;appointment.
Love, in which the imagination
mingles its bewitching colouring,
mu&#383;t be fo&#383;tered by delicacy. I &#383;hould
de&#383;pi&#383;e, or rather call her an ordinary
woman, who could endure &#383;uch a hu&#383;band
as I have &#383;ketched.</p>

<p>The&#383;e appear to me (matrimonial
de&#383;poti&#383;m of heart and conduct) to be
the peculiar Wrongs of Woman, be<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-xvii_S" id="APg_1-xvii_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-xvii.png">xvii</a>]</span>cau&#383;e
they degrade the mind. What
are termed great mi&#383;fortunes, may
more forcibly impre&#383;s the mind of common
readers; they have more of what
may ju&#383;tly be termed <i>&#383;tage-effect</i>; but
it is the delineation of finer &#383;en&#383;ations,
which, in my opinion, con&#383;titutes the
merit of our be&#383;t novels. This is what
I have in view; and to &#383;how the
wrongs of different cla&#383;&#383;es of women,
equally oppre&#383;&#383;ive, though, from the
difference of education, nece&#383;&#383;arily
various.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abodes</span> of horror have frequently

&#383;pectres and chimeras, conjured up by
the magic &#383;pell of genius to harrow the
&#383;oul, and ab&#383;orb the wondering mind.
But, formed of &#383;uch &#383;tuff as dreams are

to a keen &#383;en&#383;e of angui&#383;h, a
whirlwind of rage and indignation
rou&#383;ed her torpid pul&#383;e. One recollection
with frightful velocity following
another, threatened to fire her brain,
and make her a fit companion for the
terrific inhabitants, who&#383;e groans and
&#383;hrieks were no un&#383;ub&#383;tantial &#383;ounds of

one, true to the touch of &#383;ympathy, and
tortured by maternal apprehen&#383;ion<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '.!'">!</ins></p>

<p>Her infant's image was continually
floating on Maria's &#383;ight, and the fir&#383;t
&#383;mile of intelligence remembered, as
none but a mother, an unhappy mo<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-3_S" id="APg_1-3_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-3.png">3</a>]</span>ther,
can conceive. She heard her half
<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Errata: original reads 'speaking half'">&#383;peaking</ins> cooing, and felt the little
twinkling fingers on her burning bo&#383;om&mdash;a
bo&#383;om bur&#383;ting with the nutriment
for which this cheri&#383;hed child
might now be pining in vain. From
a &#383;tranger &#383;he could indeed receive the
maternal aliment, Maria was grieved
at the thought&mdash;but who would watch
her with a mother's tenderne&#383;s, a mother's
&#383;elf-denial?</p>

<p>The retreating &#383;hadows of former
&#383;orrows ru&#383;hed back in a gloomy train,
and &#383;eemed to be pictured on the walls
of her pri&#383;on, magnified by the &#383;tate
of mind in which they were viewed&mdash;Still
&#383;he mourned for her child, lamented
&#383;he was a daughter, and anticipated
the aggravated ills of life that her &#383;ex
rendered almo&#383;t inevitable, even while
dreading &#383;he was no more. To think<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-4_S" id="APg_1-4_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-4.png">4</a>]</span>
that &#383;he was blotted out of exi&#383;tence
was agony, when the imagination had
been long employed to expand her
faculties; yet to &#383;uppo&#383;e her turned
adrift on an unknown &#383;ea, was &#383;carcely
le&#383;s afflicting.</p>

<p>After being two days the prey of impetuous,
varying emotions, Maria began
to reflect more calmly on her pre&#383;ent
&#383;ituation, for &#383;he had actually been rendered
incapable of &#383;ober reflection, by
the di&#383;covery of the act of atrocity of
which &#383;he was the victim. She could
not have imagined, that, in all the fermentation
of civilized depravity, a &#383;imilar
plot could have entered a human
mind. She had been &#383;tunned by an unexpected
blow; yet life, however joyle&#383;s,
was not to be indolently re&#383;igned,
or mi&#383;ery endured without exertion,
and proudly termed patience. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-5_S" id="APg_1-5_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-5.png">5</a>]</span>
had hitherto meditated only to point
the dart of angui&#383;h, and &#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ed
the heart heavings of indignant nature
merely by the force of contempt. Now
&#383;he endeavoured to brace her mind to
fortitude, and to a&#383;k her&#383;elf what was
to be her employment in her dreary
cell? Was it not to effect her e&#383;cape,
to fly to the &#383;uccour of her child, and
to baffle the &#383;elfi&#383;h &#383;chemes of her tyrant&mdash;her
hu&#383;band?</p>

<p>The&#383;e thoughts rou&#383;ed her &#383;leeping
&#383;pirit, and the &#383;elf-po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion returned,
that &#383;eemed to have abandoned her in
the infernal &#383;olitude into which &#383;he
had been precipitated. The fir&#383;t emotions
of overwhelming impatience began
to &#383;ub&#383;ide, and re&#383;entment gave
place to tenderne&#383;s, and more tranquil
meditation; though anger once more
&#383;topt the calm current of reflection<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '.'">,</ins><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-6_S" id="APg_1-6_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-6.png">6</a>]</span>
when &#383;he attempted to move her manacled
arms. But this was an outrage
that could only excite momentary feelings
of &#383;corn, which evaporated in a
faint &#383;mile; for Maria was far from
thinking a per&#383;onal in&#383;ult the mo&#383;t difficult
to endure with magnanimous indifference.</p>

<p>She approached the &#383;mall grated
window of her chamber, and for a
con&#383;iderable time only regarded the
blue expan&#383;e; though it commanded
a view of a de&#383;olate garden, and of
part of a huge pile of buildings, that,
after having been &#383;uffered, for half a
century, to fall to decay, had undergone
&#383;ome clum&#383;y repairs, merely to
render it habitable. The ivy had been
torn off the turrets, and the &#383;tones not
wanted to patch up the breaches of
time, and exclude the warring ele<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-7_S" id="APg_1-7_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-7.png">7</a>]</span>ments,
left in heaps in the di&#383;ordered
court. Maria contemplated this &#383;cene
&#383;he knew not how long; or rather
gazed on the walls, and pondered on
her &#383;ituation. To the ma&#383;ter of this
mo&#383;t horrid of pri&#383;ons, &#383;he had, &#383;oon
after her entrance, raved of inju&#383;tice,
in accents that would have ju&#383;tified
his treatment, had not a malignant
&#383;mile, when &#383;he appealed to his judgment,
with a dreadful conviction &#383;tifled
her remon&#383;trating complaints. By
force, or openly, what could be done?
But &#383;urely &#383;ome expedient might occur
to an active mind, without any other
employment, and po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed of &#383;ufficient
re&#383;olution to put the ri&#383;k of life into
the balance with the chance of freedom.</p>

<p>A woman entered in the mid&#383;t of
the&#383;e reflections, with a firm, deliberate<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-8_S" id="APg_1-8_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-8.png">8</a>]</span>
&#383;tep, &#383;trongly marked features, and
large black eyes, which &#383;he fixed
&#383;teadily on Maria's, as if &#383;he de&#383;igned
to intimidate her, &#383;aying at the &#383;ame
time&mdash;"You had better &#383;it down and
eat your dinner, than look at the
clouds."</p>

<p>"I have no appetite," replied Maria,
who had previou&#383;ly determined to
&#383;peak mildly, "why then &#383;hould I
eat?"</p>

<p>"But, in &#383;pite of that, you mu&#383;t
and &#383;hall eat &#383;omething. I have had
many ladies under my care, who have
re&#383;olved to &#383;tarve them&#383;elves; but, &#383;oon
or late, they gave up their intent, as
they recovered their &#383;en&#383;es."</p>

<p>"Do you really think me mad?"
a&#383;ked Maria, meeting the &#383;earching
glance of her eye.</p>

<p>"Not ju&#383;t now. But what does<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-9_S" id="APg_1-9_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-9.png">9</a>]</span>
that prove?&mdash;only that you mu&#383;t be
the more carefully watched, for appearing
at times &#383;o rea&#383;onable. You
have not touched a mor&#383;el &#383;ince you
entered the hou&#383;e."&mdash;Maria &#383;ighed intelligibly.&mdash;"Could
any thing but madne&#383;s
produce &#383;uch a di&#383;gu&#383;t for food?"</p>

<p>"Yes, grief; you would not a&#383;k
the que&#383;tion if you knew what it
was." The attendant &#383;hook her head;
and a gha&#383;tly &#383;mile of de&#383;perate fortitude
&#383;erved as a forcible reply, and
made Maria pau&#383;e, before &#383;he added&mdash;"Yet
I will take &#383;ome refre&#383;hment:
I mean not to die.&mdash;No; I will pre&#383;erve
my &#383;en&#383;es; and convince even
you, &#383;ooner than you are aware of,
that my intellects have never been di&#383;turbed,
though the exertion of them
may have been &#383;u&#383;pended by &#383;ome infernal
drug."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-10_S" id="APg_1-10_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-10.png">10</a>]</span>
Doubt gathered &#383;till thicker on the
brow of her guard, as &#383;he attempted
to convict her of mi&#383;take.</p>

<p>"Have patience!" exclaimed Maria,
with a &#383;olemnity that in&#383;pired awe.
"My God! how have I been &#383;chooled
into the practice!" A &#383;uffocation of
voice betrayed the agonizing emotions
&#383;he was labouring to keep down; and
conquering a qualm of di&#383;gu&#383;t, &#383;he
calmly endeavoured to eat enough to
prove her docility, perpetually turning
to the &#383;u&#383;picious female, who&#383;e ob&#383;ervation
&#383;he courted, while &#383;he was
making the bed and adju&#383;ting the
room.</p>

<p>"Come to me often," &#383;aid Maria,
with a tone of per&#383;ua&#383;ion, in con&#383;equence
of a vague plan that &#383;he had
ha&#383;tily adopted, when, after &#383;urveying
this woman's form and features, &#383;he<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-11_S" id="APg_1-11_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-11.png">11</a>]</span>
felt convinced that &#383;he had an under&#383;tanding
above the common &#383;tandard;
"and believe me mad, till you are
obliged to acknowledge the contrary."
The woman was no fool, that is, &#383;he
was &#383;uperior to her cla&#383;s; nor had
mi&#383;ery quite petrified the life's-blood
of humanity, to which reflections on
our own mi&#383;fortunes only give a more
orderly cour&#383;e. The manner, rather
than the expo&#383;tulations, of Maria
made a &#383;light &#383;u&#383;picion dart into her
mind with corre&#383;ponding &#383;ympathy,
which various other avocations, and
the habit of bani&#383;hing compunction,
prevented her, for the pre&#383;ent, from
examining more minutely.</p>

<p>But when &#383;he was told that no per&#383;on,
excepting the phy&#383;ician appointed by
her family, was to be permitted to &#383;ee
the lady at the end of the gallery, &#383;he<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-12_S" id="APg_1-12_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-12.png">12</a>]</span>
opened her keen eyes &#383;till wider, and
uttered a&mdash;"hem!" before &#383;he enquired&mdash;"Why?"
She was briefly told, in
reply, that the malady was hereditary,
and the fits not occurring but at very
long and irregular intervals, &#383;he mu&#383;t
be carefully watched; for the length of
the&#383;e lucid periods only rendered her
more mi&#383;chievous, when any vexation
or caprice brought on the paroxy&#383;m of
phren&#383;y.</p>

<p>Had her ma&#383;ter tru&#383;ted her, it is
probable that neither pity nor curio&#383;ity
would have made her &#383;werve from the
&#383;traight line of her intere&#383;t; for &#383;he
had &#383;uffered too much in her intercour&#383;e
with mankind, not to determine
to look for &#383;upport, rather to humouring
their pa&#383;&#383;ions, than courting
their approbation by the integrity of
her conduct. A deadly blight had met<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-13_S" id="APg_1-13_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-13.png">13</a>]</span>
her at the very thre&#383;hold of exi&#383;tence;
and the wretchedne&#383;s of her mother
&#383;eemed a heavy weight fa&#383;tened on her
innocent neck, to drag her down to
perdition. She could not heroically
determine to &#383;uccour an unfortunate;
but, offended at the bare &#383;uppo&#383;ition
that &#383;he could be deceived with the
&#383;ame ea&#383;e as a common &#383;ervant, &#383;he
no longer curbed her curio&#383;ity; and,
though &#383;he never &#383;eriou&#383;ly fathomed
her own intentions, &#383;he would &#383;it, every
moment &#383;he could &#383;teal from ob&#383;ervation,
li&#383;tening to the tale, which Maria
was eager to relate with all the per&#383;ua&#383;ive
eloquence of grief.</p>

<p>It is &#383;o cheering to &#383;ee a human
face, even if little of the divinity of
virtue beam in it, that Maria anxiou&#383;ly
expected the return of the attendant,
as of a gleam of light to break the<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-14_S" id="APg_1-14_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-14.png">14</a>]</span>
gloom of idlene&#383;s. Indulged &#383;orrow;
&#383;he perceived, mu&#383;t blunt or &#383;harpen
the faculties to the two oppo&#383;ite extremes;
producing &#383;tupidity, the moping
melancholy of indolence; or the
re&#383;tle&#383;s activity of a di&#383;turbed imagination.
She &#383;unk into one &#383;tate, after
being fatigued by the other: till the
want of occupation became even more
painful than the actual pre&#383;&#383;ure or apprehen&#383;ion
of &#383;orrow; and the confinement
that froze her into a nook of
exi&#383;tence, with an unvaried pro&#383;pect
before her, the mo&#383;t in&#383;upportable of
evils. The lamp of life &#383;eemed to be
&#383;pending it&#383;elf to cha&#383;e the vapours of
a dungeon which no art could di&#383;&#383;ipate.&mdash;And
to what purpo&#383;e did &#383;he
rally all her energy?&mdash;Was not the
world a va&#383;t pri&#383;on, and women born
&#383;laves?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-15_S" id="APg_1-15_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-15.png">15</a>]</span>
Though &#383;he failed immediately to
rou&#383;e a lively &#383;en&#383;e of inju&#383;tice in the
mind of her guard, becau&#383;e it had
been &#383;ophi&#383;ticated into mi&#383;anthropy,
&#383;he touched her heart. Jemima (&#383;he
had only a claim to a Chri&#383;tian name,
which had not procured her any Chri&#383;tian
privileges) could patiently hear of
Maria's confinement on fal&#383;e pretences;
&#383;he had felt the cru&#383;hing hand of
power, hardened by the exerci&#383;e of
inju&#383;tice, and cea&#383;ed to wonder at the
perver&#383;ions of the under&#383;tanding, which
&#383;y&#383;tematize oppre&#383;&#383;ion; but, when told
that her child, only four months old,
had been torn from her, even while
&#383;he was di&#383;charging the tendere&#383;t maternal
office, the woman awoke in a
bo&#383;om long e&#383;tranged from feminine
emotions, and Jemima determined to
alleviate all in her power, without ha<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-16_S" id="APg_1-16_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-16.png">16</a>]</span>zarding
the lo&#383;s of her place, the &#383;ufferings
of a wretched mother, apparently
injured, and certainly unhappy.
A &#383;en&#383;e of right &#383;eems to re&#383;ult from
the &#383;imple&#383;t act of rea&#383;on, and to pre&#383;ide
over the faculties of the mind,
like the ma&#383;ter-&#383;en&#383;e of feeling, to
rectify the re&#383;t; but (for the compari&#383;on
may be carried &#383;till farther) how
often is the exqui&#383;ite &#383;en&#383;ibility of
both weakened or de&#383;troyed by the
vulgar occupations, and ignoble plea&#383;ures
of life?</p>

<p>The pre&#383;erving her &#383;ituation was,
indeed, an important object to Jemima,
who had been hunted from hole
to hole, as if &#383;he had been a bea&#383;t of
prey, or infected with a moral plague.
The wages &#383;he received, the greater
part of which &#383;he hoarded, as her only
chance for independence, were much<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-17_S" id="APg_1-17_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-17.png">17</a>]</span>
more con&#383;iderable than &#383;he could reckon
on obtaining any where el&#383;e, were
it po&#383;&#383;ible that &#383;he, an outca&#383;t from
&#383;ociety, could be permitted to earn a
&#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence in a reputable family. Hearing
Maria perpetually complain of li&#383;tle&#383;&#383;ne&#383;s,
and the not being able to beguile
grief by re&#383;uming her cu&#383;tomary
pur&#383;uits, &#383;he was ea&#383;ily prevailed on,
by compa&#383;&#383;ion, and that involuntary
re&#383;pect for abilities, which tho&#383;e who
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s them can never eradicate, to
bring her &#383;ome books and implements
for writing. Maria's conver&#383;ation had
amu&#383;ed and intere&#383;ted her, and the natural
con&#383;equence was a de&#383;ire, &#383;carcely
ob&#383;erved by her&#383;elf, of obtaining the
e&#383;teem of a per&#383;on &#383;he admired. The
remembrance of better days was rendered
more lively; and the &#383;entiments
then acquired appearing le&#383;s romantic<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-18_S" id="APg_1-18_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-18.png">18</a>]</span>
than they had for a long period, a
&#383;park of hope rou&#383;ed her mind to new
activity.</p>

<p>How grateful was her attention to
Maria! Oppre&#383;&#383;ed by a dead weight
of exi&#383;tence, or preyed on by the
gnawing worm of di&#383;content, with
what eagerne&#383;s did &#383;he endeavour to
&#383;horten the long days, which left no
traces behind! She &#383;eemed to be
&#383;ailing on the va&#383;t ocean of life, without
&#383;eeing any land-mark to indicate
the progre&#383;s of time; to find employment
was then to find variety, the
animating principle of nature.</p>

<h2><a name="ACHAP_II_S" id="ACHAP_II_S"></a>CHAP. II.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Earne&#383;tly</span> as Maria endeavoured
to &#383;oothe, by reading, the angui&#383;h
of her wounded mind, her thoughts
would often wander from the &#383;ubject
&#383;he was led to di&#383;cu&#383;s, and tears of
maternal tenderne&#383;s ob&#383;cured the rea&#383;oning
page. She de&#383;canted on "the
ills which fle&#383;h is heir to," with bitterne&#383;s,
when the recollection of her
babe was revived by a tale of fictitious
woe, that bore any re&#383;emblance to her
own; and her imagination was continually
employed, to conjure up and
embody the various phantoms of mi&#383;ery,
which folly and vice had let loo&#383;e
on the world. The lo&#383;s of her babe
was the tender &#383;tring; again&#383;t other
cruel remembrances &#383;he laboured to<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-20_S" id="APg_1-20_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-20.png">20</a>]</span>
&#383;teel her bo&#383;om; and even a ray of
hope, in the mid&#383;t of her gloomy reveries,
would &#383;ometimes gleam on the
dark horizon of futurity, while per&#383;uading
her&#383;elf that &#383;he ought to cea&#383;e
to hope, &#383;ince happine&#383;s was no where
to be found.&mdash;But of her child, debilitated
by the grief with which its
mother had been a&#383;&#383;ailed before it &#383;aw
the light, &#383;he could not think without
an impatient &#383;truggle.</p>

<p>"I, alone, by my active tenderne&#383;s,
could have &#383;aved," &#383;he would exclaim,
"from an early blight, this &#383;weet
blo&#383;&#383;om; and, cheri&#383;hing it, I &#383;hould
have had &#383;omething &#383;till to love."</p>

<p>In proportion as other expectations
were torn from her, this tender one
had been fondly clung to, and knit
into her heart.</p>

<p>The books &#383;he had obtained, were<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-21_S" id="APg_1-21_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-21.png">21</a>]</span>
&#383;oon devoured, by one who had no
other re&#383;ource to e&#383;cape from &#383;orrow,
and the feveri&#383;h dreams of ideal wretchedne&#383;s
or felicity, which equally weaken
the intoxicated &#383;en&#383;ibility. Writing
was then the only alternative, and
&#383;he wrote &#383;ome rhap&#383;odies de&#383;criptive
of the &#383;tate of her mind; but the
events of her pa&#383;t life pre&#383;&#383;ing on her,
&#383;he re&#383;olved circum&#383;tantially to relate
them, with the &#383;entiments that experience,
and more matured rea&#383;on,
would naturally &#383;ugge&#383;t. They might
perhaps in&#383;truct her daughter, and
&#383;hield her from the mi&#383;ery, the tyranny,
her mother knew not how to avoid.</p>

<p>This thought gave life to her diction,
her &#383;oul flowed into it, and &#383;he &#383;oon
found the ta&#383;k of recollecting almo&#383;t
obliterated impre&#383;&#383;ions very intere&#383;ting.
She lived again in the revived emo<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-22_S" id="APg_1-22_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-22.png">22</a>]</span>tions
of youth, and forgot her pre&#383;ent
in the retro&#383;pect of &#383;orrows that had
a&#383;&#383;umed an unalterable character.</p>

<p>Though this employment lightened
the weight of time, yet, never lo&#383;ing
&#383;ight of her main object, Maria did
not allow any opportunity to &#383;lip of
winning on the affections of Jemima;
for &#383;he di&#383;covered in her a &#383;trength of
mind, that excited her e&#383;teem, clouded
as it was by the mi&#383;anthropy of de&#383;pair.</p>

<p>An in&#383;ulated being, from the mi&#383;fortune
of her birth, &#383;he de&#383;pi&#383;ed and
preyed on the &#383;ociety by which &#383;he
had been oppre&#383;&#383;ed, and loved not her
fellow-creatures, becau&#383;e &#383;he had never
been beloved. No mother had ever
fondled her, no father or brother had
protected her from outrage; and the
man who had plunged her into in<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-23_S" id="APg_1-23_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-23.png">23</a>]</span>famy,
and de&#383;erted her when &#383;he &#383;tood
in greate&#383;t need of &#383;upport, deigned
not to &#383;mooth with kindne&#383;s the road
to ruin. Thus degraded, was &#383;he let
loo&#383;e on the world; and virtue, never
nurtured by affection, a&#383;&#383;umed the &#383;tern
a&#383;pect of &#383;elfi&#383;h independence.</p>

<p>This general view of her life, Maria
gathered from her exclamations and
dry remarks. Jemima indeed di&#383;played
a &#383;trange mixture of intere&#383;t
and &#383;u&#383;picion; for &#383;he would li&#383;ten to
her with earne&#383;tne&#383;s, and then &#383;uddenly
interrupt the conver&#383;ation, as if
afraid of re&#383;igning, by giving way to
her &#383;ympathy, her dear-bought knowledge
of the world.</p>

<p>Maria alluded to the po&#383;&#383;ibility of
an e&#383;cape, and mentioned a compen&#383;ation,
or reward; but the &#383;tyle in which
&#383;he was repul&#383;ed made her cautious,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-24_S" id="APg_1-24_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-24.png">24</a>]</span>
and determine not to renew the &#383;ubject,
till &#383;he knew more of the character
&#383;he had to work on. Jemima's
countenance, and dark hints, &#383;eemed
to &#383;ay, "You are an extraordinary
woman; but let me con&#383;ider, this may
only be one of your lucid intervals."
Nay, the very energy of Maria's character,
made her &#383;u&#383;pect that the extraordinary
animation &#383;he perceived
might be the effect of madne&#383;s. "Should
her hu&#383;band then &#383;ub&#383;tantiate his
charge, and get po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of her e&#383;tate,
from whence would come the promi&#383;ed
annuity, or more de&#383;ired protection?
Be&#383;ides, might not a woman, anxious
to e&#383;cape, conceal &#383;ome of the circum&#383;tances
which made again&#383;t her? Was
truth to be expected from one who
had been entrapped, kidnapped, in
the mo&#383;t fraudulent manner?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-25_S" id="APg_1-25_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-25.png">25</a>]</span>
In this train Jemima continued to
argue, the moment after compa&#383;&#383;ion
and re&#383;pect &#383;eemed to make her &#383;werve;
and &#383;he &#383;till re&#383;olved not to be wrought
on to do more than &#383;often the rigour
of confinement, till &#383;he could advance
on &#383;urer ground.</p>

<p>Maria was not permitted to walk in
the garden; but &#383;ometimes, from her
window, &#383;he turned her eyes from the
gloomy walls, in which &#383;he pined life
away, on the poor wretches who &#383;trayed
along the walks, and contemplated
the mo&#383;t terrific of ruins&mdash;that of a
human &#383;oul. What is the view of the
fallen column, the mouldering arch, of
the mo&#383;t exqui&#383;ite workman&#383;hip, when
compared with this living memento of
the fragility, the in&#383;tability, of rea&#383;on,
and the wild luxuriancy of noxious
pa&#383;&#383;ions? Enthu&#383;ia&#383;m turned adrift,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-26_S" id="APg_1-26_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-26.png">26</a>]</span>
like &#383;ome rich &#383;tream overflowing its
banks, ru&#383;hes forward with de&#383;tructive
velocity, in&#383;piring a &#383;ublime concentration
of thought. Thus thought
Maria&mdash;The&#383;e are the ravages over
which humanity mu&#383;t ever mournfully
ponder, with a degree of angui&#383;h not
excited by crumbling marble, or cankering
bra&#383;s, unfaithful to the tru&#383;t of
monumental fame. It is not over the
decaying productions of the mind, embodied
with the happie&#383;t art, we grieve
mo&#383;t bitterly. The view of what has
been done by man, produces a melancholy,
yet aggrandizing, &#383;en&#383;e of what
remains to be achieved by human intellect;
but a mental convul&#383;ion, which,
like the deva&#383;tation of an earthquake,
throws all the elements of thought and
imagination into confu&#383;ion, makes con<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-27_S" id="APg_1-27_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-27.png">27</a>]</span>templation
giddy, and we fearfully a&#383;k
on what ground we our&#383;elves &#383;tand.</p>

<p>Melancholy and imbecility marked
the features of the wretches allowed to
breathe at large; for the frantic, tho&#383;e
who in a &#383;trong imagination had lo&#383;t a
&#383;en&#383;e of woe, were clo&#383;ely confined.
The playful tricks and mi&#383;chievous devices
of their di&#383;turbed fancy, that &#383;uddenly
broke out, could not be guarded
again&#383;t, when they were permitted to
enjoy any portion of freedom; for,
&#383;o active was their imagination, that
every new object which accidentally
&#383;truck their &#383;en&#383;es, awoke to phrenzy
their re&#383;tle&#383;s pa&#383;&#383;ions; as Maria learned
from the burden of their ince&#383;&#383;ant
ravings.</p>

<p>Sometimes, with a &#383;trict injunction
of &#383;ilence, Jemima would allow Maria,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-28_S" id="APg_1-28_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-28.png">28</a>]</span>
at the clo&#383;e of evening, to &#383;tray along
the narrow avenues that &#383;eparated the
dungeon-like apartments, leaning on
her arm. What a change of &#383;cene!
Maria wi&#383;hed to pa&#383;s the thre&#383;hold of
her pri&#383;on, yet, when by chance &#383;he
met the eye of rage glaring on her, yet
unfaithful to its office, &#383;he &#383;hrunk back
with more horror and affright, than if
&#383;he had &#383;tumbled over a mangled corp&#383;e.
Her bu&#383;y fancy pictured the mi&#383;ery of a
fond heart, watching over a friend thus
e&#383;tranged, ab&#383;ent, though pre&#383;ent&mdash;over
a poor wretch lo&#383;t to rea&#383;on and the
&#383;ocial joys of exi&#383;tence; and lo&#383;ing all
con&#383;ciou&#383;ne&#383;s of mi&#383;ery in its exce&#383;s.
What a ta&#383;k, to watch the light of rea&#383;on
quivering in the eye, or with agonizing
expectation to catch the beam of recollection;
tantalized by hope, only to
feel de&#383;pair more keenly, at finding a<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-29_S" id="APg_1-29_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-29.png">29</a>]</span>
much loved face or voice, &#383;uddenly remembered,
or pathetically implored,
only to be immediately forgotten, or
viewed with indifference or abhorrence!</p>

<p>The heart-rending &#383;igh of melancholy
&#383;unk into her &#383;oul; and when &#383;he retired
to re&#383;t, the petrified figures &#383;he
had encountered, the only human forms
&#383;he was doomed to ob&#383;erve, haunting
her dreams with tales of my&#383;terious
wrongs, made her wi&#383;h to &#383;leep to dream
no more.</p>

<p>Day after day rolled away, and tedious
as the pre&#383;ent moment appeared,
they pa&#383;&#383;ed in &#383;uch an unvaried tenor,
Maria was &#383;urpri&#383;ed to find that &#383;he
had already been &#383;ix weeks buried alive,
and yet had &#383;uch faint hopes of effecting
her enlargement. She was, earne&#383;tly
as &#383;he had &#383;ought for employment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-30_S" id="APg_1-30_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-30.png">30</a>]</span>
now angry with her&#383;elf for having been
amu&#383;ed by writing her narrative; and
grieved to think that &#383;he had for an in&#383;tant
thought of any thing, but contriving
to e&#383;cape.</p>

<p>Jemima had evidently plea&#383;ure in
her &#383;ociety: &#383;till, though &#383;he often left
her with a glow of kindne&#383;s, &#383;he returned
with the &#383;ame chilling air; and,
when her heart appeared for a moment
to open, &#383;ome &#383;ugge&#383;tion of rea&#383;on forcibly
clo&#383;ed it, before &#383;he could give
utterance to the confidence Maria's
conver&#383;ation in&#383;pired.</p>

<p>Di&#383;couraged by the&#383;e changes, Maria
relap&#383;ed into de&#383;pondency, when &#383;he
was cheered by the alacrity with which
Jemima brought her a fre&#383;h parcel of
books; a&#383;&#383;uring her, that &#383;he had taken
&#383;ome pains to obtain them from one of
the keepers, who attended a gentle<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-31_S" id="APg_1-31_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-31.png">31</a>]</span>man
confined in the oppo&#383;ite corner of
the gallery.</p>

<p>Maria took up the books with emotion.
"They come," &#383;aid &#383;he, "perhaps,
from a wretch condemned, like
me, to rea&#383;on on the nature of madne&#383;s,
by having wrecked minds continually
under his eye; and almo&#383;t to wi&#383;h him&#383;elf&mdash;as
I do&mdash;mad, to e&#383;cape from the
contemplation of it." Her heart throbbed
with &#383;ympathetic alarm; and &#383;he
turned over the leaves with awe, as if
they had become &#383;acred from pa&#383;&#383;ing
through the hands of an unfortunate
being, oppre&#383;&#383;ed by a &#383;imilar fate.</p>

<p>Dryden's Fables, Milton's Paradi&#383;e
Lo&#383;t, with &#383;everal modern productions,
compo&#383;ed the collection. It was a
mine of trea&#383;ure. Some marginal notes,
in Dryden's Fables, caught her attention:
they were written with force<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-32_S" id="APg_1-32_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-32.png">32</a>]</span>
and ta&#383;te; and, in one of the modern
pamphlets, there was a fragment left,
containing various ob&#383;ervations on the
pre&#383;ent &#383;tate of &#383;ociety and government,
with a comparative view of the
politics of Europe and America. The&#383;e
remarks were written with a degree of
generous warmth, when alluding to the
en&#383;laved &#383;tate of the labouring majority,
perfectly in uni&#383;on with Maria's mode
of thinking.</p>

<p>She read them over and over again;
and fancy, treacherous fancy, began to
&#383;ketch a character, congenial with her
own, from the&#383;e &#383;hadowy outlines.&mdash;"Was
he mad?" She re-peru&#383;ed the
marginal notes, and they &#383;eemed the
production of an animated, but not of a
di&#383;turbed imagination. Confined to
this &#383;peculation, every time &#383;he re-read
them, &#383;ome fre&#383;h refinement of<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-33_S" id="APg_1-33_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-33.png">33</a>]</span>
&#383;entiment, or <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'accutene&#383;s'">acutene&#383;s</ins> of thought
impre&#383;&#383;ed her, which &#383;he was a&#383;toni&#383;hed
at her&#383;elf for not having before ob&#383;erved.</p>

<p>What a creative power has an affectionate
heart! There are beings who
cannot live without loving, as poets
love; and who feel the electric &#383;park
of genius, wherever it awakens &#383;entiment
or grace. Maria had often thought,
when di&#383;ciplining her wayward heart,
"that to charm, was to be virtuous."
"They who make me wi&#383;h to appear
the mo&#383;t amiable and good in their eyes,
mu&#383;t po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s in a degree," &#383;he would
exclaim, "the graces and virtues they
call into action."</p>

<p>She took up a book on the powers of
the human mind; but, her attention
&#383;trayed from cold arguments on the
nature of what &#383;he felt, while &#383;he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-34_S" id="APg_1-34_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-34.png">34</a>]</span>
feeling, and &#383;he &#383;napt the chain of the
theory to read Dryden's Gui&#383;card and
Sigi&#383;munda.</p>

<p>Maria, in the cour&#383;e of the en&#383;uing
day, returned &#383;ome of the books, with
the hope of getting others&mdash;and more
marginal notes. Thus &#383;hut out from
human intercour&#383;e, and compelled to
view nothing but the pri&#383;on of vexed
&#383;pirits, to meet a wretch in the &#383;ame
&#383;ituation, was more &#383;urely to find a
friend, than to imagine a countryman
one, in a &#383;trange land, where the human
voice conveys no information to
the eager ear.</p>

<p>"Did you ever &#383;ee the unfortunate
being to whom the&#383;e books belong?"
a&#383;ked Maria, when Jemima brought
her &#383;upper. "Yes. He &#383;ometimes
walks out, between five and &#383;ix, before
the family is &#383;tirring, in the morning,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-35_S" id="APg_1-35_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-35.png">35</a>]</span>
with two keepers; but even then his
hands are confined."</p>

<p>"What! is he &#383;o unruly?" enquired
Maria, with an accent of di&#383;appointment.</p>

<p>"No, not that I perceive," replied
Jemima; "but he has an untamed
look, a vehemence of eye, that excites
apprehen&#383;ion. Were his hands free,
he looks as if he could &#383;oon manage
both his guards: yet he appears
tranquil."</p>

<p>"If he be &#383;o &#383;trong, he mu&#383;t be
young," ob&#383;erved Maria.</p>

<p>"Three or four and thirty, I &#383;uppo&#383;e;
but there is no judging of a
per&#383;on in his &#383;ituation."</p>

<p>"Are you &#383;ure that he is mad?"
interrupted Maria with eagerne&#383;s. Jemima
quitted the room, without replying.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-36_S" id="APg_1-36_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-36.png">36</a>]</span>
"No, no, he certainly is not!" exclaimed
Maria, an&#383;wering her&#383;elf;
"the man who could write tho&#383;e ob&#383;ervations
was not di&#383;ordered in his
intellects."</p>

<p>She &#383;at mu&#383;ing, gazing at the moon,
and watching its motion as it &#383;eemed
to glide under the clouds. Then, preparing
for bed, &#383;he thought, "Of
what u&#383;e could I be to him, or he to
me, if it be true that he is unju&#383;tly
confined?&mdash;Could he aid me to e&#383;cape,
who is him&#383;elf more clo&#383;ely watched?&mdash;Still
I &#383;hould like to &#383;ee him." She
went to bed, dreamed of her child,
yet woke exactly at half after five
o'clock, and &#383;tarting up, only wrapped
a gown around her, and ran to the
window. The morning was chill, it
was the latter end of September; yet
&#383;he did not retire to warm her&#383;elf and<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-37_S" id="APg_1-37_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-37.png">37</a>]</span>
think in bed, till the &#383;ound of the
&#383;ervants, moving about the hou&#383;e, convinced
her that the unknown would
not walk in the garden that morning.
She was a&#383;hamed at feeling di&#383;appointed;
and began to reflect, as an excu&#383;e
to her&#383;elf, on the little objects which
attract attention when there is nothing
to divert the mind; and how difficult
it was for women to avoid growing
romantic, who have no active duties
or pur&#383;uits.</p>

<p>At breakfa&#383;t, Jemima enquired whether
&#383;he under&#383;tood French? for, unle&#383;s
&#383;he did, the &#383;tranger's &#383;tock of
books was exhau&#383;ted. Maria replied
in the affirmative; but forbore to a&#383;k
any more que&#383;tions re&#383;pecting the per&#383;on
to whom they belonged. And Jemima
gave her a new &#383;ubject for contemplation,
by de&#383;cribing the per&#383;on<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-38_S" id="APg_1-38_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-38.png">38</a>]</span>
of a lovely maniac, ju&#383;t brought into
an adjoining chamber. She was &#383;inging
the pathetic ballad of old Rob &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
with the mo&#383;t heart-melting
falls and pau&#383;es. Jemima had half-opened
the door, when &#383;he di&#383;tingui&#383;hed
her voice, and Maria &#383;tood clo&#383;e to it,
&#383;carcely daring to re&#383;pire, le&#383;t a modulation
&#383;hould e&#383;cape her, &#383;o exqui&#383;itely
&#383;weet, &#383;o pa&#383;&#383;ionately wild. She
began with &#383;ympathy to pourtray to
her&#383;elf another victim, when the lovely
warbler flew, as it were, from the
&#383;pray, and a torrent of unconnected
exclamations and que&#383;tions bur&#383;t from
her, interrupted by fits of laughter, &#383;o
horrid, that Maria &#383;hut the door, and,
turning her eyes up to heaven, exclaimed&mdash;"Gracious
God!"</p>

<p>Several minutes elap&#383;ed before Maria
could enquire re&#383;pecting the ru<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-39_S" id="APg_1-39_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-39.png">39</a>]</span>mour
of the hou&#383;e (for this poor
wretch was obviou&#383;ly not confined
without a cau&#383;e); and then Jemima
could only tell her, that it was &#383;aid,
"&#383;he had been married, again&#383;t her
inclination, to a rich old man, extremely
jealous (no wonder, for &#383;he
was a charming creature); and that,
in con&#383;equence of his treatment, or
&#383;omething which hung on her mind,
&#383;he had, during her fir&#383;t lying-in, lo&#383;t
her &#383;en&#383;es."</p>

<p>What a &#383;ubject of meditation&mdash;even
to the very confines of madne&#383;s.</p>

<p>"Woman, fragile flower! why
were you &#383;uffered to adorn a world
expo&#383;ed to the inroad of &#383;uch &#383;tormy
elements?" thought Maria, while the
poor maniac's &#383;train was &#383;till breathing
on her ear, and &#383;inking into her very
&#383;oul.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-40_S" id="APg_1-40_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-40.png">40</a>]</span>
Towards the evening, Jemima brought
her Rou&#383;&#383;eau's <i>Helo&iuml;&#383;e</i>; and &#383;he &#383;at
reading with eyes and heart, till the
return of her guard to extingui&#383;h the
light. One in&#383;tance of her kindne&#383;s
was, the permitting Maria to have
one, till her own hour of retiring to
re&#383;t. She had read this work long
&#383;ince; but now it &#383;eemed to open a
new world to her&mdash;the only one worth
inhabiting. Sleep was not to be
wooed; yet, far from being fatigued
by the re&#383;tle&#383;s rotation of thought, &#383;he
ro&#383;e and opened her window, ju&#383;t as
the thin watery clouds of twilight
made the long &#383;ilent &#383;hadows vi&#383;ible.
The air &#383;wept acro&#383;s her face with a
voluptuous fre&#383;hne&#383;s that thrilled to
her heart, awakening indefinable emotions;
and the &#383;ound of a waving
branch, or the twittering of a &#383;tartled<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-41_S" id="APg_1-41_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-41.png">41</a>]</span>
bird, alone broke the &#383;tillne&#383;s of repo&#383;ing
nature. Ab&#383;orbed by the &#383;ublime
&#383;en&#383;ibility which renders the con&#383;ciou&#383;ne&#383;s
of exi&#383;tence felicity, Maria
was happy, till an autumnal &#383;cent,
wafted by the breeze of morn from
the fallen leaves of the adjacent wood,
made her recollect that the &#383;ea&#383;on had
changed &#383;ince her confinement; yet
life afforded no variety to &#383;olace an
afflicted heart. She returned di&#383;pirited
to her couch, and thought of her child
till the broad glare of day again invited
her to the window. She looked
not for the unknown, &#383;till how great
was her vexation at perceiving the
back of a man, certainly he, with his
two attendants, as he turned into a
&#383;ide-path which led to the hou&#383;e! A
confu&#383;ed recollection of having &#383;een
&#383;omebody who re&#383;embled him, imme<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-42_S" id="APg_1-42_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-42.png">42</a>]</span>diately
occurred, to puzzle and torment
her with endle&#383;s conjectures. Five
minutes &#383;ooner, and &#383;he &#383;hould have
&#383;een his face, and been out of &#383;u&#383;pen&#383;e&mdash;was
ever any thing &#383;o unlucky!
His &#383;teady, bold &#383;tep, and the whole
air of his per&#383;on, bur&#383;ting as it were
from a cloud, plea&#383;ed her, and gave
an outline to the imagination to &#383;ketch
the individual form &#383;he wi&#383;hed to recognize.</p>

<p>Feeling the di&#383;appointment more
&#383;everely than &#383;he was willing to believe,
&#383;he flew to Rou&#383;&#383;eau, as her
only refuge from the idea of him, who
might prove a friend, could &#383;he but
find a way to intere&#383;t him in her fate;
&#383;till the per&#383;onification of Saint Preux,
or of an ideal lover far &#383;uperior, was
after this imperfect model, of which
merely a glance had been caught,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-43_S" id="APg_1-43_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-43.png">43</a>]</span>
even to the minuti&aelig; of the coat and
hat of the &#383;tranger. But if &#383;he lent
St. Preux, or the demi-god of her
fancy, his form, &#383;he richly repaid him
by the donation of all St. Preux's
&#383;entiments and feelings, culled to gratify
her own, to which he &#383;eemed to
have an undoubted right, when &#383;he
read on the margin of an impa&#383;&#383;ioned
letter, written in the well-known hand&mdash;"Rou&#383;&#383;eau
alone, the true Prometheus
of &#383;entiment, po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed the fire
of genius nece&#383;&#383;ary to pourtray the
pa&#383;&#383;ion, the truth of which goes &#383;o
directly to the heart."</p>

<p>Maria was again true to the hour, yet
had fini&#383;hed Rou&#383;&#383;eau, and begun to
tran&#383;cribe &#383;ome &#383;elected pa&#383;&#383;ages; unable
to quit either the author or the window,
before &#383;he had a glimp&#383;e of the
countenance &#383;he daily longed to &#383;ee;<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-44_S" id="APg_1-44_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-44.png">44</a>]</span>
and, when &#383;een, it conveyed no di&#383;tinct
idea to her mind where &#383;he had
&#383;een it before. He mu&#383;t have been a
tran&#383;ient acquaintance; but to di&#383;cover
an acquaintance was fortunate, could
&#383;he contrive to attract his attention,
and excite his &#383;ympathy.</p>

<p>Every glance afforded colouring for
the picture &#383;he was delineating on her
heart; and once, when the window
was half open, the &#383;ound of his voice
reached her. Conviction fla&#383;hed on
her; &#383;he had certainly, in a moment
of di&#383;tre&#383;s, heard the &#383;ame accents.
They were manly, and characteri&#383;tic
of a noble mind; nay, even &#383;weet&mdash;or
&#383;weet they &#383;eemed to her attentive
ear.</p>

<p>She &#383;tarted back, trembling, alarmed
at the emotion a &#383;trange coincidence
of circum&#383;tances in&#383;pired, and wonder<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-45_S" id="APg_1-45_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-45.png">45</a>]</span>ing
why &#383;he thought &#383;o much of a
&#383;tranger, obliged as &#383;he had been by
his timely interference; [for &#383;he recollected,
by degrees, all the circum&#383;tances
of their former meeting.] She
found however that &#383;he could think
of nothing el&#383;e; or, if &#383;he thought of
her daughter, it was to wi&#383;h that &#383;he
had a father whom her mother could
re&#383;pect and love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> peru&#383;ing the fir&#383;t parcel of
books, Maria had, with her pencil, written
in one of them a few exclamations,
expre&#383;&#383;ive of compa&#383;&#383;ion and &#383;ympathy,
which &#383;he &#383;carcely remembered, till
turning over the leaves of one of the
volumes, lately brought to her, a &#383;lip
of paper dropped out, which Jemima
ha&#383;tily &#383;natched up.</p>

<p>"Let me &#383;ee it," demanded Maria
impatiently, "You &#383;urely are not
afraid of tru&#383;ting me with the effu&#383;ions
of a madman?" "I mu&#383;t con&#383;ider," replied
Jemima; and withdrew, with
the paper in her hand.</p>

<p>In a life of &#383;uch &#383;eclu&#383;ion, the pa&#383;&#383;ions
gain undue force; Maria therefore
felt a great degree of re&#383;entment and<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-47_S" id="APg_1-47_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-47.png">47</a>]</span>
vexation, which &#383;he had not time to
&#383;ubdue, before Jemima, returning, delivered
the paper.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Whoever you are, who partake of

<p>By the mo&#383;t pre&#383;&#383;ing intreaties, Maria
prevailed on Jemima to permit her to
write a reply to this note. Another<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-48_S" id="APg_1-48_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-48.png">48</a>]</span>
and another &#383;ucceeded, in which explanations
were not allowed relative to
their pre&#383;ent &#383;ituation; but Maria, with
&#383;ufficient explicitne&#383;s, alluded to a former
obligation; and they in&#383;en&#383;ibly entered
on an interchange of &#383;entiments
on the mo&#383;t important &#383;ubjects. To
write the&#383;e letters was the bu&#383;ine&#383;s of
the day, and to receive them the moment
of &#383;un&#383;hine. By &#383;ome means,
Darnford having di&#383;covered Maria's
window, when &#383;he next appeared at
it, he made her, behind his keepers, a
profound bow of re&#383;pect and recognition.</p>

<p>Two or three weeks glided away in
this kind of intercour&#383;e, during which
period Jemima, to whom Maria had
given the nece&#383;&#383;ary information re&#383;pecting
her family, had evidently gained
&#383;ome intelligence, which increa&#383;ed her<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-49_S" id="APg_1-49_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-49.png">49</a>]</span>
de&#383;ire of plea&#383;ing her charge, though
&#383;he could not yet determine to liberate
her. Maria took advantage of this
favourable charge, without too minutely
enquiring into the cau&#383;e; and &#383;uch
was her eagerne&#383;s to hold human conver&#383;e,
and to &#383;ee her former protector,
&#383;till a &#383;tranger to her, that &#383;he ince&#383;&#383;antly
reque&#383;ted her guard to gratify her more
than curio&#383;ity.</p>

<p>Writing to Darnford, &#383;he was led
from the &#383;ad objects before her, and
frequently rendered in&#383;en&#383;ible to the
horrid noi&#383;es around her, which previou&#383;ly
had continually employed her
feveri&#383;h fancy. Thinking it &#383;elfi&#383;h to
dwell on her own &#383;ufferings, when in
the mid&#383;t of wretches, who had not
only lo&#383;t all that endears life, but their
very &#383;elves, her imagination was oc<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-50_S" id="APg_1-50_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-50.png">50</a>]</span>cupied
with melancholy earne&#383;tne&#383;s to
trace the mazes of mi&#383;ery, through
which &#383;o many wretches mu&#383;t have
pa&#383;&#383;ed to this gloomy receptacle of di&#383;jointed
&#383;ouls, to the grand &#383;ource of
human corruption. Often at midnight
was &#383;he waked by the di&#383;mal &#383;hrieks of
demoniac rage, or of excruciating de&#383;pair,
uttered in &#383;uch wild tones of inde&#383;cribable
angui&#383;h as proved the total
ab&#383;ence of rea&#383;on, and rou&#383;ed phantoms
of horror in her mind, far more
terrific than all that dreaming &#383;uper&#383;tition
ever drew. Be&#383;ides, there was
frequently &#383;omething &#383;o inconceivably
picture&#383;que in the varying ge&#383;tures of
unre&#383;trained pa&#383;&#383;ion, &#383;o irre&#383;i&#383;tibly comic
in their &#383;allies, or &#383;o heart-piercingly
pathetic in the little airs they would
&#383;ing, frequently bur&#383;ting out after an
awful &#383;ilence, as to fa&#383;cinate the at<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-51_S" id="APg_1-51_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-51.png">51</a>]</span>tention,
and amu&#383;e the fancy, while
torturing the &#383;oul. It was the uproar
of the pa&#383;&#383;ions which &#383;he was compelled
to ob&#383;erve; and to mark the
lucid beam of rea&#383;on, like a light
trembling in a &#383;ocket, or like the
fla&#383;h which divides the threatening
clouds of angry heaven only to di&#383;play
the horrors which darkne&#383;s &#383;hrouded.</p>

<p>Jemima would labour to beguile the
tedious evenings, by de&#383;cribing the
per&#383;ons and manners of the <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'unfortutunate'">unfortunate</ins>
beings, who&#383;e figures or voices
awoke &#383;ympathetic &#383;orrow in Maria's
bo&#383;om; and the &#383;tories &#383;he told were
the more intere&#383;ting, for perpetually
leaving room to conjecture &#383;omething
extraordinary. Still Maria, accu&#383;tomed
to generalize her ob&#383;ervations, was
led to conclude from all &#383;he heard,
that it was a vulgar error to &#383;uppo&#383;e<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-52_S" id="APg_1-52_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-52.png">52</a>]</span>
that people of abilities were the mo&#383;t
apt to lo&#383;e the command of rea&#383;on.
On the contrary, from mo&#383;t of the in&#383;tances
&#383;he could inve&#383;tigate, &#383;he thought
it re&#383;ulted, that the pa&#383;&#383;ions only appeared
&#383;trong and di&#383;proportioned, becau&#383;e
the judgment was weak and unexerci&#383;ed;
and that they gained &#383;trength
by the decay of rea&#383;on, as the &#383;hadows
lengthen during the &#383;un's decline.</p>

<p>Maria impatiently wi&#383;hed to &#383;ee her
fellow-&#383;ufferer; but Darnford was &#383;till
more earne&#383;t to obtain an interview.
Accu&#383;tomed to &#383;ubmit to every impul&#383;e
of pa&#383;&#383;ion, and never taught, like
women, to re&#383;train the mo&#383;t natural,
and acquire, in&#383;tead of the bewitching
frankne&#383;s of nature, a factitious propriety
of behaviour, every de&#383;ire became
a torrent that bore down all oppo&#383;ition.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-53_S" id="APg_1-53_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-53.png">53</a>]</span>
His travelling trunk, which contained
the books lent to Maria, had
been &#383;ent to him, and with a part of
its contents he bribed his principal
keeper; who, after receiving the mo&#383;t
&#383;olemn promi&#383;e that he would return
to his apartment without attempting
to explore any part of the hou&#383;e, conducted
him, in the du&#383;k of the evening,
to Maria's room.</p>

<p>Jemima had apprized her charge of
the vi&#383;it, and &#383;he expected with trembling
impatience, in&#383;pired by a vague
hope that he might again prove her
deliverer, to &#383;ee a man who had before
re&#383;cued her from oppre&#383;&#383;ion. He entered
with an animation of countenance,
formed to captivate an enthu&#383;ia&#383;t;
and, ha&#383;tily turned his eyes from
her to the apartment, which he &#383;urveyed
with apparent emotions of com<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-54_S" id="APg_1-54_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-54.png">54</a>]</span>pa&#383;&#383;ionate
indignation. Sympathy illuminated
his eye, and, taking her hand,
he re&#383;pectfully bowed on it, exclaiming&mdash;"This
is extraordinary!&mdash;again
to meet you, and in &#383;uch circum&#383;tances!"
Still, impre&#383;&#383;ive as was the
coincidence of events which brought
them once more together, their full
hearts did not overflow.&mdash;<a name="AFNanchor_54-A_3_S" id="AFNanchor_54-A_3_S"></a><a href="#AFootnote_54-A_3_S" class="fnanchor">[54-A]</a></p>

<hr />

<p>[And though, after this fir&#383;t vi&#383;it,
they were permitted frequently to repeat
their interviews, they were for
&#383;ome time employed in] a re&#383;erved
conver&#383;ation, to which all the world<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-55_S" id="APg_1-55_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-55.png">55</a>]</span>
might have li&#383;tened; excepting, when
di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ing &#383;ome literary &#383;ubject, fla&#383;hes
of &#383;entiment, inforced by each relaxing
feature, &#383;eemed to remind them
that their minds were already acquainted.</p>

<p>[By degrees, Darnford entered into
the particulars of his &#383;tory.] In a few
words, he informed her that he had been
a thoughtle&#383;s, extravagant young man;
yet, as he de&#383;cribed his faults, they appeared
to be the generous luxuriancy of
a noble mind. Nothing like meanne&#383;s
tarni&#383;hed the lu&#383;tre of his youth, nor had
the worm of &#383;elfi&#383;hne&#383;s lurked in the unfolding
bud, even while he had been the
dupe of others. Yet he tardily acquired
the experience nece&#383;&#383;ary to guard
him again&#383;t future impo&#383;ition.</p>

<p>"I &#383;hall weary you," continued he,
"by my egoti&#383;m; and did not power<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-56_S" id="APg_1-56_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-56.png">56</a>]</span>ful
emotions draw me to you,"&mdash;his
eyes gli&#383;tened as he &#383;poke, and a trembling
&#383;eemed to run through his manly
frame,&mdash;"I would not wa&#383;te the&#383;e precious
moments in talking of my&#383;elf.</p>

<p>"My father and mother were people
of fa&#383;hion; married by their parents. He
was fond of the turf, &#383;he of the card-table.
I, and two or three other children
&#383;ince dead, were kept at home
till we became intolerable. My father
and mother had a vi&#383;ible di&#383;like
to each other, continually di&#383;played;
the &#383;ervants were of the depraved kind
u&#383;ually found in the hou&#383;es of people
of fortune. My brothers and parents
all dying, I was left to the care of
guardians, and &#383;ent to Eton. I never
knew the &#383;weets of dome&#383;tic affection,
but I felt the want of indulgence and
frivolous re&#383;pect at &#383;chool. I will not<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-57_S" id="APg_1-57_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-57.png">57</a>]</span>
di&#383;gu&#383;t you with a recital of the vices
of my youth, which can &#383;carcely be comprehended
by female delicacy. I was
taught to love by a creature I am
a&#383;hamed to mention; and the other
women with whom I afterwards became
intimate, were of a cla&#383;s of which
you can have no knowledge. I formed
my acquaintance with them at the
theatres; and, when vivacity danced
in their eyes, I was not ea&#383;ily di&#383;gu&#383;ted
by the vulgarity which flowed from
their lips. Having &#383;pent, a few years
after I was of age, [the whole of] a
con&#383;iderable patrimony, excepting a
few hundreds, I had no <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 're&#383;ource'">recour&#383;e</ins> but
to purcha&#383;e a commi&#383;&#383;ion in a new-rai&#383;ed
regiment, de&#383;tined to &#383;ubjugate
America. The regret I felt to renounce
a life of plea&#383;ure, was counter-balanced
by the curio&#383;ity I had to &#383;ee<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-58_S" id="APg_1-58_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-58.png">58</a>]</span>
America, or rather to travel; [nor
had any of tho&#383;e circum&#383;tances occurred
to my youth, which might have
been calculated] to bind my country
to my heart. I &#383;hall not trouble you
with the details of a military life. My
blood was &#383;till kept in motion; till,
towards the clo&#383;e of the conte&#383;t, I was
wounded and taken pri&#383;oner.</p>

<p>"Confined to my bed, or chair, by a
lingering cure, my only refuge from
the preying activity of my mind, was
books, which I read with great avidity,
profiting by the conver&#383;ation of my
ho&#383;t, a man of &#383;ound under&#383;tanding.
My political &#383;entiments now underwent
a total change; and, dazzled by
the ho&#383;pitality of the Americans, I
determined to take up my abode with
freedom. I, therefore, with my u&#383;ual
impetuo&#383;ity, &#383;old my commi&#383;&#383;ion, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-59_S" id="APg_1-59_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-59.png">59</a>]</span>
travelled into the interior parts of the
country, to lay out my money to advantage.
Added to this, I did not
much like the puritanical manners of
the large towns. Inequality of condition
was there mo&#383;t di&#383;gu&#383;tingly galling.
The only plea&#383;ure wealth afforded,
was to make an o&#383;tentatious
di&#383;play of it; for the cultivation of
the fine arts, or literature, had not introduced
into the fir&#383;t circles that poli&#383;h
of manners which renders the rich &#383;o e&#383;&#383;entially
&#383;uperior to the poor in Europe.
Added to this, an influx of vices had
been let in by the Revolution, and the
mo&#383;t rigid principles of religion &#383;haken
to the centre, before the under&#383;tanding
could be gradually emancipated from
the prejudices which led their ance&#383;tors
undauntedly to &#383;eek an inho&#383;pitable
clime and unbroken &#383;oil. The re&#383;olu<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-60_S" id="APg_1-60_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-60.png">60</a>]</span>tion,
that led them, in pur&#383;uit of independence,
to embark on rivers like
&#383;eas, to &#383;earch for unknown &#383;hores,
and to &#383;leep under the hovering mi&#383;ts
of endle&#383;s fore&#383;ts, who&#383;e baleful damps
agued their limbs, was now turned into
commercial &#383;peculations, till the national
character exhibited a phenomenon
in the hi&#383;tory of the human mind&mdash;a
head enthu&#383;ia&#383;tically enterpri&#383;ing, with
cold &#383;elfi&#383;hne&#383;s of heart. And woman,
lovely woman!&mdash;they charm every
where&mdash;&#383;till there is a degree of prudery,
and a want of ta&#383;te and ea&#383;e in
the manners of the American women,
that renders them, in &#383;pite of their ro&#383;es
and lilies, far inferior to our European
charmers. In the country, they have
often a bewitching &#383;implicity of character;
but, in the cities, they have all
the airs and ignorance of the ladies who<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-61_S" id="APg_1-61_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-61.png">61</a>]</span>
give the tone to the circles of the large
trading towns in England. They are
fond of their ornaments, merely becau&#383;e
they are good, and not becau&#383;e
they embelli&#383;h their per&#383;ons; and are
more gratified to in&#383;pire the women
with jealou&#383;y of the&#383;e exterior advantages,
than the men with love. All
the frivolity which often (excu&#383;e me,
Madam) renders the &#383;ociety of mode&#383;t
women &#383;o &#383;tupid in England, here
&#383;eemed to throw &#383;till more leaden fetters
on their charms. Not being an
adept in gallantry, I found that I could
only keep my&#383;elf awake in their company
by making downright love to
them.</p>

<p>"But, not to intrude on your patience,
I retired to the track of land
which I had purcha&#383;ed in the country,
and my time pa&#383;&#383;ed plea&#383;antly enough<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-62_S" id="APg_1-62_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-62.png">62</a>]</span>
while I cut down the trees, built my
hou&#383;e, and planted my different crops.
But winter and idlene&#383;s came, and I
longed for more elegant &#383;ociety, to hear
what was pa&#383;&#383;ing in the world, and to
do &#383;omething better than vegetate with
the animals that made a very con&#383;iderable
part of my hou&#383;ehold. Con&#383;equently,
I determined to travel. Motion was
a &#383;ub&#383;titute for variety of objects; and,
pa&#383;&#383;ing over immen&#383;e tracks of country,
I exhau&#383;ted my exuberant &#383;pirits, without
obtaining much experience. I every
where &#383;aw indu&#383;try the fore-runner
and not the con&#383;equence, of luxury;
but this country, every thing being on
an ample &#383;cale, did not afford tho&#383;e
picture&#383;que views, which a certain degree
of cultivation is nece&#383;&#383;ary gradually
to produce. The eye wandered
without an object to fix upon over im<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-63_S" id="APg_1-63_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-63.png">63</a>]</span>mea&#383;ureable
plains, and lakes that &#383;eemed
repleni&#383;hed by the ocean, whil&#383;t eternal
fore&#383;ts of &#383;mall clu&#383;tering trees, ob&#383;tructed
the circulation of air, and embarra&#383;&#383;ed
the path, without gratifying
the eye of ta&#383;te. No cottage &#383;miling in
the wa&#383;te, no travellers hailed us, to give
life to &#383;ilent nature; or, if perchance
we &#383;aw the print of a foot&#383;tep in our
path, it was a dreadful warning to turn
a&#383;ide; and the head ached as if a&#383;&#383;ailed
by the &#383;calping knife. The Indians
who hovered on the &#383;kirts of the European
&#383;ettlements had only learned of
their neighbours to plunder, and they
&#383;tole their guns from them to do it with
more &#383;afety.</p>

<p>"From the woods and back &#383;ettlements,
I returned to the towns, and
learned to eat and drink mo&#383;t valiantly;
but without entering into commerce<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-64_S" id="APg_1-64_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-64.png">64</a>]</span>
(and I dete&#383;ted commerce) I found I
could not live there; and, growing heartily
weary of the land of liberty and
vulgar ari&#383;tocracy, &#383;eated on her bags
of dollars, I re&#383;olved once more to vi&#383;it
Europe. I wrote to a di&#383;tant relation
in England, with whom I had been
educated, mentioning the ve&#383;&#383;el in
which I intended to &#383;ail. Arriving in
London, my &#383;en&#383;es were intoxicated. I
ran from &#383;treet to &#383;treet, from theatre
to theatre, and the women of the town
(again I mu&#383;t beg pardon for my habitual
frankne&#383;s) appeared to me like
angels.</p>

<p>"A week was &#383;pent in this thoughtle&#383;s
manner, when, returning very late
to the hotel in which I had lodged ever
&#383;ince my arrival, I was knocked down
in a private &#383;treet, and hurried, in a &#383;tate
of in&#383;en&#383;ibility, into a coach, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-65_S" id="APg_1-65_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-65.png">65</a>]</span>
brought me hither, and I only recovered
my &#383;en&#383;es to be treated like one
who had lo&#383;t them. My keepers are
deaf to my remon&#383;trances and enquiries,
yet a&#383;&#383;ure me that my confinement
&#383;hall not la&#383;t long. Still I cannot gue&#383;s,
though I weary my&#383;elf with conjectures,
why I am confined, or in what
part of England this hou&#383;e is &#383;ituated.
I imagine &#383;ometimes that I hear the
&#383;ea roar, and wi&#383;hed my&#383;elf again on

<h2><a name="ACHAP_IV_S" id="ACHAP_IV_S"></a>CHAP. IV.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Pity</span>, and the forlorn &#383;eriou&#383;ne&#383;s of
adver&#383;ity, have both been con&#383;idered as
di&#383;po&#383;itions favourable to love, while
&#383;atirical writers have attributed the
propen&#383;ity to the relaxing effect of
<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added mi&#383;&#383;ing comma">idlene&#383;s,</ins> what chance then had Maria
of e&#383;caping, when pity, &#383;orrow,
and &#383;olitude all con&#383;pired to &#383;often her
mind, and nouri&#383;h romantic wi&#383;hes,
and, from a natural progre&#383;s, romantic
expectations?</p>

<p>Maria was &#383;ix-and-twenty. But,
&#383;uch was the native &#383;oundne&#383;s of her
con&#383;titution, that time had only given
to her countenance the character of her
mind. Revolving thought, and exerci&#383;ed
affections had bani&#383;hed &#383;ome of<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-68_S" id="APg_1-68_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-68.png">68</a>]</span>
the playful graces of innocence, producing
in&#383;en&#383;ibly that irregularity of
features which the &#383;truggles of the under&#383;tanding
to trace or govern the
&#383;trong emotions of the heart, are wont
to imprint on the yielding ma&#383;s. Grief
and care had mellowed, without ob&#383;curing,
the bright tints of youth, and
the thoughtfulne&#383;s which re&#383;ided on her
brow did not take from the feminine
&#383;oftne&#383;s of her features; nay, &#383;uch was
the &#383;en&#383;ibility which often mantled over
it, that &#383;he frequently appeared, like a
large proportion of her &#383;ex, only born
to feel; and the activity of her well-proportioned,
and even almo&#383;t voluptuous
figure, in&#383;pired the idea of
&#383;trength of mind, rather than of body.
There was a &#383;implicity &#383;ometimes indeed
in her manner, which bordered
on infantine ingenuou&#383;ne&#383;s, that led peo<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-69_S" id="APg_1-69_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-69.png">69</a>]</span>ple
of common di&#383;cernment to underrate
her talents, and &#383;mile at the flights
of her imagination. But tho&#383;e who
could not comprehend the delicacy of
her &#383;entiments, were attached by her
unfailing &#383;ympathy, &#383;o that &#383;he was very
generally beloved by characters of very
different de&#383;criptions; &#383;till, &#383;he was too
much under the influence of an ardent
imagination to adhere to common rules.</p>

<p>There are mi&#383;takes of conduct which
at five-and-twenty prove the &#383;trength of
the mind, that, ten or fifteen years after,
would demon&#383;trate its weakne&#383;s, its incapacity
to acquire a &#383;ane judgment.
The youths who are &#383;ati&#383;fied with the
ordinary plea&#383;ures of life, and do not
&#383;igh after ideal phantoms of love and
friend&#383;hip, will never arrive at great maturity
of under&#383;tanding; but if the&#383;e reveries
are cheri&#383;hed, as is too frequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-70_S" id="APg_1-70_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-70.png">70</a>]</span>
the ca&#383;e with women, when experience
ought to have taught them in what human
happine&#383;s con&#383;i&#383;ts, they become as
u&#383;ele&#383;s as they are wretched. Be&#383;ides,
their pains and plea&#383;ures are &#383;o dependent
on outward circum&#383;tances, on the
objects of their affections, that they
&#383;eldom act from the impul&#383;e of a nerved
mind, able to choo&#383;e its own pur&#383;uit.</p>

<p>Having had to &#383;truggle ince&#383;&#383;antly
with the vices of mankind, Maria's
imagination found repo&#383;e in pourtraying
the po&#383;&#383;ible virtues the world might
contain. Pygmalion formed an ivory
maid, and longed for an informing &#383;oul.
She, on the contrary, combined all the
qualities of a hero's mind, and fate
pre&#383;ented a &#383;tatue in which &#383;he might
en&#383;hrine them.</p>

<p>We mean not to trace the progre&#383;s
of this pa&#383;&#383;ion, or recount how often<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-71_S" id="APg_1-71_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-71.png">71</a>]</span>
Darnford and Maria were obliged to
part in the mid&#383;t of an intere&#383;ting conver&#383;ation.
Jemima ever watched on
the tip-toe of fear, and frequently &#383;eparated
them on a fal&#383;e alarm, when
they would have given worlds to remain
a little longer together.</p>

<p>A magic lamp now &#383;eemed to be &#383;u&#383;pended
in Maria's pri&#383;on, and fairy
land&#383;capes flitted round the gloomy
walls, late &#383;o blank. Ru&#383;hing from the
depth of de&#383;pair, on the &#383;eraph wing of
hope, &#383;he found her&#383;elf happy.&mdash;She was
beloved, and every emotion was rapturous.</p>

<p>To Darnford &#383;he had not &#383;hown a decided
affection; the fear of outrunning
his, a &#383;ure proof of love, made her often
a&#383;&#383;ume a coldne&#383;s and indifference foreign
from her character; and, even when
giving way to the playful emotions of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-72_S" id="APg_1-72_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-72.png">72</a>]</span>
heart ju&#383;t loo&#383;ened from the frozen
bond of grief, there was a delicacy in
her manner of expre&#383;&#383;ing her &#383;en&#383;ibility,
which made him doubt whether it
was the effect of love.</p>

<p>One evening, when Jemima left them,
to li&#383;ten to the &#383;ound of a di&#383;tant foot&#383;tep,
which &#383;eemed cautiou&#383;ly to approach,
he &#383;eized Maria's hand&mdash;it was
not withdrawn. They conver&#383;ed with
earne&#383;tne&#383;s of their &#383;ituation; and, during
the conver&#383;ation, he once or twice
gently drew her towards him. He felt
the fragrance of her breath, and longed,
yet feared, to touch the lips from
which it i&#383;&#383;ued; &#383;pirits of purity &#383;eemed
to guard them, while all the enchanting
graces of love &#383;ported on her cheeks,
and langui&#383;hed in her eyes.</p>

<p>Jemima entering, he reflected on his
diffidence with poignant regret, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-73_S" id="APg_1-73_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-73.png">73</a>]</span>
&#383;he once more taking alarm, he ventured,
as Maria &#383;tood near his chair, to
approach her lips with a declaration of
love. She drew back with &#383;olemnity,
he hung down his head aba&#383;hed; but
lifting his eyes timidly, they met her's;
&#383;he had determined, during that in&#383;tant,
and &#383;uffered their rays to mingle. He
took, with more ardour, rea&#383;&#383;ured, a
half-con&#383;enting, half-reluctant ki&#383;s, reluctant
only from mode&#383;ty; and there
was a &#383;acredne&#383;s in her dignified manner
of reclining her glowing face on
his &#383;houlder, that powerfully impre&#383;&#383;ed
him. De&#383;ire was lo&#383;t in more ineffable
emotions, and to protect her from in&#383;ult
and &#383;orrow&mdash;to make her happy,
&#383;eemed not only the fir&#383;t wi&#383;h of his heart,
but the mo&#383;t noble duty of his life.
Such angelic confidence demanded the
fidelity of honour; but could he, feel<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-74_S" id="APg_1-74_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-74.png">74</a>]</span>ing
her in every pul&#383;ation, could he
ever change, could he be a villain? The
emotion with which &#383;he, for a moment,
allowed her&#383;elf to be pre&#383;&#383;ed to his bo&#383;om,
the tear of rapturous &#383;ympathy,
mingled with a &#383;oft melancholy &#383;entiment
of recollected di&#383;appointment,
&#383;aid&mdash;more of truth and faithfulne&#383;s,
than the tongue could have given utterance
to in hours! They were &#383;ilent&mdash;yet
di&#383;cour&#383;ed, how eloquently? till,
after a moment's reflection, Maria drew
her chair by the &#383;ide of his, and, with
a compo&#383;ed &#383;weetne&#383;s of voice, and
&#383;upernatural benignity of countenance,
&#383;aid, "I mu&#383;t open my whole heart
to you; you mu&#383;t be told who I am,
why I am here, and why, telling you
I am a wife, I blu&#383;h not to"&mdash;the blu&#383;h
&#383;poke the re&#383;t.</p>

<p>Jemima was again at her elbow, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-75_S" id="APg_1-75_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-75.png">75</a>]</span>
the re&#383;traint of her pre&#383;ence did not
prevent an animated conver&#383;ation, in
which love, &#383;ly urchin, was ever at bo-peep.</p>

<p>So much of heaven did they enjoy,
that paradi&#383;e bloomed around them; or
they, by a powerful &#383;pell, had been
tran&#383;ported into Armida's garden. Love,
the grand enchanter, "lapt them in Ely&#383;ium,"
and every &#383;en&#383;e was harmonized
to joy and &#383;ocial extacy. So animated,
indeed, were their accents of tenderne&#383;s,
in di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ing what, in other circum&#383;tances,
would have been common-place
&#383;ubjects, that Jemima felt, with
&#383;urpri&#383;e, a tear of plea&#383;ure trickling
down her rugged cheeks. She wiped
it away, half a&#383;hamed; and when Maria
kindly enquired the cau&#383;e, with all
the eager &#383;olicitude of a happy being
wi&#383;hing to impart to all nature its<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-76_S" id="APg_1-76_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-76.png">76</a>]</span>
overflowing felicity, Jemima owned
that it was the fir&#383;t tear that &#383;ocial enjoyment
had ever drawn from her. She
&#383;eemed indeed to breathe more freely;
the cloud of &#383;u&#383;picion cleared away
from her brow; &#383;he felt her&#383;elf, for
once in her life, treated like a fellow-creature.</p>

<p>Imagination! who can paint thy
power; or reflect the evane&#383;cent tints
of hope fo&#383;tered by thee? A de&#383;pondent
gloom had long ob&#383;cured Maria's horizon&mdash;now
the &#383;un broke forth, the
rainbow appeared, and every pro&#383;pect
was fair. Horror &#383;till reigned in the
darkened cells, &#383;u&#383;picion lurked in the
pa&#383;&#383;ages, and whi&#383;pered along the
walls. The yells of men po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed,
&#383;ometimes made them pau&#383;e, and wonder
that they felt &#383;o happy, in a tomb
of living death. They even chid them<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-77_S" id="APg_1-77_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-77.png">77</a>]</span>&#383;elves
for &#383;uch apparent in&#383;en&#383;ibility;
&#383;till the world contained not three happier
beings. And Jemima, after again
patrolling the pa&#383;&#383;age, was &#383;o &#383;oftened
by the air of confidence which breathed
around her, that &#383;he voluntarily began
an account of her&#383;elf.</p>

<h2><a name="ACHAP_V_S" id="ACHAP_V_S"></a>CHAP. V.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">My</span> father," &#383;aid Jemima, "&#383;educed
my mother, a pretty girl, with whom
he lived fellow-&#383;ervant; and &#383;he no
&#383;ooner perceived the natural, the dreaded
con&#383;equence, than the terrible conviction
fla&#383;hed on her&mdash;that &#383;he was
ruined. Hone&#383;ty, and a regard for her
reputation, had been the only principles
inculcated by her mother; and
they had been &#383;o forcibly impre&#383;&#383;ed, that
&#383;he feared &#383;hame, more than the poverty
to which it would lead. Her ince&#383;&#383;ant
importunities to prevail upon my father
to &#383;creen her from reproach by marrying
her, as he had promi&#383;ed in the
fervour of &#383;eduction, e&#383;tranged him from
her &#383;o completely, that her very per&#383;on<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-79_S" id="APg_1-79_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-79.png">79</a>]</span>
became di&#383;ta&#383;teful to him; and he began
to hate, as well as de&#383;pi&#383;e me, before
I was born.</p>

<p>"My mother, grieved to the &#383;oul by
his neglect, and unkind treatment, actually
re&#383;olved to fami&#383;h her&#383;elf; and
injured her health by the attempt;
though &#383;he had not &#383;ufficient re&#383;olution
to adhere to her project, or renounce it
entirely. Death came not at her call;
yet &#383;orrow, and the methods &#383;he adopted
to conceal her condition, &#383;till doing the
work of a hou&#383;e-maid, had &#383;uch an
effect on her con&#383;titution, that &#383;he died
in the wretched garret, where her virtuous
mi&#383;tre&#383;s had forced her to take
refuge in the very pangs of labour,
though my father, after a &#383;light reproof,
was allowed to remain in his place&mdash;allowed
by the mother of &#383;ix children,
who, &#383;carcely permitting a foot&#383;tep to<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-80_S" id="APg_1-80_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-80.png">80</a>]</span>
be heard, during her month's indulgence,
felt no &#383;ympathy for the poor
wretch, denied every comfort required
by her &#383;ituation.</p>

<p>"The day my mother died, the
ninth after my birth, I was con&#383;igned
to the care of the cheape&#383;t nur&#383;e my
father could find; who &#383;uckled her own
child at the &#383;ame time, and lodged as
many more as &#383;he could get, in two
cellar-like apartments.</p>

<p>"Poverty, and the habit of &#383;eeing
children die off her hands, had &#383;o
hardened her heart, that the office of a
mother did not awaken the tenderne&#383;s
of a woman; nor were the feminine
care&#383;&#383;es which &#383;eem a part of the rearing
of a child, ever be&#383;towed on me.
The chicken has a wing to &#383;helter under;
but I had no bo&#383;om to ne&#383;tle in,
no kindred warmth to fo&#383;ter me. Left<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-81_S" id="APg_1-81_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-81.png">81</a>]</span>
in dirt, to cry with cold and hunger
till I was weary, and &#383;leep without ever
being prepared by exerci&#383;e, or lulled
by kindne&#383;s to re&#383;t; could I be expected
to become any thing but a weak and
rickety babe? Still, in &#383;pite of neglect,
I continued to exi&#383;t, to learn to
cur&#383;e exi&#383;tence,<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Errata: original reads '['">"</ins> her countenance grew
ferocious as &#383;he &#383;poke, <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Errata: original reads ']'">"</ins>and the treatment
that rendered me mi&#383;erable, &#383;eemed
to &#383;harpen my wits. Confined then
in a damp hovel, to rock the cradle of
the &#383;ucceeding tribe, I looked like a
little old woman, or a hag &#383;hrivelling into
nothing. The furrows of reflection and
care contracted the youthful cheek,
and gave a &#383;ort of &#383;upernatural wildne&#383;s
to the ever watchful eye. During
this period, my father had married another
fellow-&#383;ervant, who loved him
le&#383;s, and knew better how to manage<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-82_S" id="APg_1-82_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-82.png">82</a>]</span>
his pa&#383;&#383;ion, than my mother. She likewi&#383;e
proving with child, they agreed
to keep a &#383;hop: my &#383;tep-mother, if, being
an illegitimate off&#383;pring, I may
venture thus to characterize her, having
obtained a &#383;um of a rich relation,
for that purpo&#383;e.</p>

<p>"Soon after her lying-in, &#383;he prevailed
on my father to take me home, to &#383;ave
the expence of maintaining me, and
of hiring a girl to a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t her in the care
of the child. I was young, it was true,
but appeared a knowing little thing,
and might be made handy. Accordingly
I was brought to her hou&#383;e; but
not to a home&mdash;for a home I never
knew. Of this child, a daughter, &#383;he
was extravagantly fond; and it was a
part of my employment, to a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t to &#383;poil
her, by humouring all her whims, and
bearing all her caprices. Feeling her<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-83_S" id="APg_1-83_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-83.png">83</a>]</span>
own con&#383;equence, before &#383;he could
&#383;peak, &#383;he had learned the art of tormenting
me, and if I ever dared to re&#383;i&#383;t,
I received blows, laid on with no
compunctious hand, or was &#383;ent to bed
dinnerle&#383;s, as well as &#383;upperle&#383;s. I &#383;aid
that it was a part of my daily labour to
attend this child, with the &#383;ervility of a
&#383;lave; &#383;till it was but a part. I was
&#383;ent out in all &#383;ea&#383;ons, and from place
to place, to carry burdens far above
my &#383;trength, without being allowed to
draw near the fire, or ever being
cheered by encouragement or kindne&#383;s.
No wonder then, treated like a
creature of another &#383;pecies, that I began
to envy, and at length to hate,
the darling of the hou&#383;e. Yet, I perfectly
remember, that it was the care&#383;&#383;es,
and kind expre&#383;&#383;ions of my &#383;tep-mother,
which fir&#383;t excited my jealous<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-84_S" id="APg_1-84_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-84.png">84</a>]</span>
di&#383;content. Once, I cannot forget it,
when &#383;he was calling in vain her wayward
child to ki&#383;s her, I ran to her,
&#383;aying, 'I will ki&#383;s you, ma'am!' and
how did my heart, which was in my
mouth, &#383;ink, what was my deba&#383;ement
of &#383;oul, when pu&#383;hed away with&mdash;'I
do not want you, pert thing!'
Another day, when a new gown had
excited the highe&#383;t good humour, and
&#383;he uttered the appropriate <i>dear</i>, addre&#383;&#383;ed
unexpectedly to me, I thought
I could never do enough to plea&#383;e her;
I was all alacrity, and ro&#383;e proportionably
in my own e&#383;timation.</p>

<p>"As her daughter grew up, &#383;he was
pampered with cakes and fruit, while
I was, literally &#383;peaking, fed with the
refu&#383;e of the table, with her leavings.
A liquori&#383;h tooth is, I believe, common
to children, and I u&#383;ed to &#383;teal any<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-85_S" id="APg_1-85_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-85.png">85</a>]</span>
thing &#383;weet, that I could catch up with
a chance of concealment. When detected,
&#383;he was not content to cha&#383;tize
me her&#383;elf at the moment, but, on my
father's return in the evening (he was
a &#383;hopman), the principal di&#383;cour&#383;e was
to recount my faults, and attribute
them to the wicked di&#383;po&#383;ition which I
had brought into the world with me,
inherited from my mother. He did not
fail to leave the marks of his re&#383;entment
on my body, and then &#383;olaced
him&#383;elf by playing with my &#383;i&#383;ter.&mdash;I
could have murdered her at tho&#383;e moments.
To &#383;ave my&#383;elf from the&#383;e unmerciful
corrections, I re&#383;orted to fal&#383;hood,
and the untruths which I &#383;turdily
maintained, were brought in judgment
again&#383;t me, to &#383;upport my tyrant's
inhuman charge of my natural propen&#383;ity
to vice. Seeing me treated with<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-86_S" id="APg_1-86_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-86.png">86</a>]</span>
contempt, and always being fed and
dre&#383;&#383;ed better, my &#383;i&#383;ter conceived a
contemptuous opinion of me, that
proved an ob&#383;tacle to all affection; and
my father, hearing continually of my
faults, began to con&#383;ider me as a cur&#383;e
entailed on him for his &#383;ins: he was
therefore ea&#383;ily prevailed on to bind
me apprentice to one of my &#383;tep-mother's
friends, who kept a &#383;lop-&#383;hop in
Wapping. I was repre&#383;ented (as it
was &#383;aid) in my true colours; but &#383;he,
'warranted,' &#383;napping her fingers,
'that &#383;he &#383;hould break my &#383;pirit or
heart.'</p>

<p>"My mother replied, with a whine,
'that if any body could make me better,
it was &#383;uch a clever woman as her&#383;elf;
though, for her own part, &#383;he had
tried in vain; but good-nature was her
fault.'</p>

"I &#383;hudder with horror, when I recollect
the treatment I had now to endure.
Not only under the la&#383;h of my ta&#383;k-mi&#383;tre&#383;s,
but the drudge of the maid,
apprentices and children, I never had
a ta&#383;te of human kindne&#383;s to &#383;often the
rigour of perpetual labour. I had been
introduced as an object of abhorrence
into the family; as a creature of whom
my &#383;tep-mother, though &#383;he had been
kind enough to let me live in the hou&#383;e
with her own child, could make nothing.
I was de&#383;cribed as a wretch,
who&#383;e no&#383;e mu&#383;t be kept to the grinding
&#383;tone&mdash;and it was held there with
an iron gra&#383;p. It &#383;eemed indeed the
privilege of their &#383;uperior nature to kick
me about, like the dog or cat. If I
were attentive, I was called fawning,
if refractory, an ob&#383;tinate mule, and
like a mule I received their cen&#383;ure on<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-88_S" id="APg_1-88_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-88.png">88</a>]</span>
my loaded back. Often has my mi&#383;tre&#383;s,
for &#383;ome in&#383;tance of forgetfulne&#383;s, thrown
me from one &#383;ide of the kitchen to the
other, knocked my head again&#383;t the
wall, &#383;pit in my face, with various refinements
on barbarity that I forbear to
enumerate, though they were all acted
over again by the &#383;ervant, with additional
in&#383;ults, to which the appellation
of <i>ba&#383;tard</i>, was commonly added, with
taunts or &#383;neers. But I will not attempt
to give you an adequate idea of
my &#383;ituation, le&#383;t you, who probably
have never been drenched with the
dregs of human mi&#383;ery, &#383;hould think I
exaggerate.</p>

<p>"I &#383;tole now, from ab&#383;olute nece&#383;&#383;ity,&mdash;bread;
yet whatever el&#383;e was
taken, which I had it not in my power
to take, was a&#383;cribed to me. I was
the filching cat, the ravenous dog, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-89_S" id="APg_1-89_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-89.png">89</a>]</span>
dumb brute, who mu&#383;t bear all; for if
I endeavoured to exculpate my&#383;elf, I
was &#383;ilenced, without any enquiries
being made, with 'Hold your tongue,
you never tell truth.' Even the very
air I breathed was tainted with &#383;corn;
for I was &#383;ent to the neighbouring &#383;hops
with Glutton, Liar, or Thief, written on
my forehead. This was, at fir&#383;t, the
mo&#383;t bitter puni&#383;hment; but &#383;ullen
pride, or a kind of &#383;tupid de&#383;peration,
made me, at length, almo&#383;t regardle&#383;s
of the contempt, which had wrung
from me &#383;o many &#383;olitary tears at the
only moments when I was allowed to
re&#383;t.</p>

<p>"Thus was I the mark of cruelty till
my &#383;ixteenth year; and then I have
only to point out a change of mi&#383;ery;
for a period I never knew. Allow me
fir&#383;t to make one ob&#383;ervation. Now I<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-90_S" id="APg_1-90_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-90.png">90</a>]</span>
look back, I cannot help attributing the
greater part of my mi&#383;ery, to the mi&#383;fortune
of having been thrown into the
world without the grand &#383;upport of life&mdash;a
mother's affection. I had no one to
love me; or to make me re&#383;pected, to
enable me to acquire re&#383;pect. I was an
egg dropped on the &#383;and; a pauper by
nature, <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'hunted'">&#383;hunted</ins> from family to family,
who belonged to nobody&mdash;and nobody
cared for me. I was de&#383;pi&#383;ed from my
birth, and denied the chance of obtaining
a footing for my&#383;elf in &#383;ociety. Yes;
I had not even the chance of being
con&#383;idered as a fellow-creature&mdash;yet all
the people with whom I lived, brutalized
as they were by the low cunning
of trade, and the de&#383;picable &#383;hifts of
poverty, were not without bowels,
though they never yearned for me. I
was, in fact, born a &#383;lave, and chained<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-91_S" id="APg_1-91_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-91.png">91</a>]</span>
by infamy to &#383;lavery during the whole
of exi&#383;tence, without having any companions
to alleviate it by &#383;ympathy, or
teach me how to ri&#383;e above it by their
example. But, to re&#383;ume the thread of
my tale&mdash;</p>

<p>"At &#383;ixteen, I &#383;uddenly grew tall,
and &#383;omething like comeline&#383;s appeared
on a Sunday, when I had time to wa&#383;h
my face, and put on clean clothes. My
ma&#383;ter had once or twice caught hold
of me in the pa&#383;&#383;age; but I in&#383;tinctively
avoided his di&#383;gu&#383;ting care&#383;&#383;es. One
day however, when the family were
at a methodi&#383;t meeting, he contrived to
be alone in the hou&#383;e with me, and by
blows&mdash;yes; blows and menaces, compelled
me to &#383;ubmit to his ferocious
de&#383;ire; and, to avoid my mi&#383;tre&#383;s's
fury, I was obliged in future to comply,
and &#383;kulk to my loft at his com<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-92_S" id="APg_1-92_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-92.png">92</a>]</span>mand,
in &#383;pite of increa&#383;ing loathing.</p>

<p>"The angui&#383;h which was now pent
up in my bo&#383;om, &#383;eemed to open a new
world to me: I began to extend my
thoughts beyond my&#383;elf, and grieve
for human mi&#383;ery, till I di&#383;covered,
with horror&mdash;ah! what horror!&mdash;that I
was with child. I know not why I felt
a mixed &#383;en&#383;ation of de&#383;pair and tenderne&#383;s,
excepting that, ever called a
ba&#383;tard, a ba&#383;tard appeared to me an
object of the greate&#383;t compa&#383;&#383;ion in
creation.</p>

<p>"I communicated this dreadful circum&#383;tance
to my ma&#383;ter, who was almo&#383;t
equally alarmed at the intelligence;
for he feared his wife, and public
cen&#383;ure at the meeting. After &#383;ome
weeks of deliberation had elap&#383;ed, I in
continual fear that my altered &#383;hape<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-93_S" id="APg_1-93_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-93.png">93</a>]</span>
would be noticed, my ma&#383;ter gave me
a medicine in a phial, which he de&#383;ired
me to take, telling me, without any
circumlocution, for what purpo&#383;e it
was de&#383;igned. I bur&#383;t into tears, I
thought it was killing my&#383;elf&mdash;yet was
&#383;uch a &#383;elf as I worth pre&#383;erving? He
cur&#383;ed me for a fool, and left me to my
own reflections. I could not re&#383;olve to
take this infernal potion; but I wrapped
it up in an old gown, and hid it
in a corner of my box.</p>

<p>"Nobody yet &#383;u&#383;pected me, becau&#383;e
they had been accu&#383;tomed to view me
as a creature of another &#383;pecies. But
the threatening &#383;torm at la&#383;t broke over
my devoted head&mdash;never &#383;hall I forget
it! One Sunday evening when I was
left, as u&#383;ual, to take care of the hou&#383;e,
my ma&#383;ter came home intoxicated, and
I became the prey of his brutal appe<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-94_S" id="APg_1-94_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-94.png">94</a>]</span>tite.
His extreme intoxication made
him forget his cu&#383;tomary caution, and
my mi&#383;tre&#383;s entered and found us in a
&#383;ituation that could not have been more
hateful to her than me. Her hu&#383;band
was 'pot-valiant,' he feared her not
at the moment, nor had he then much
rea&#383;on, for &#383;he in&#383;tantly turned the
whole force of her anger another
way. She tore off my cap, &#383;cratched,
kicked, and buffetted me, till &#383;he had
exhau&#383;ted her &#383;trength, declaring, as &#383;he
re&#383;ted her arm, 'that I had wheedled
her hu&#383;band from her.&mdash;But, could any
thing better be expected from a wretch,
whom &#383;he had taken into her hou&#383;e out
of pure charity?' What a torrent of
abu&#383;e ru&#383;hed out? till, almo&#383;t breathle&#383;s,
&#383;he concluded with &#383;aying, 'that I
was born a &#383;trumpet; it ran in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-95_S" id="APg_1-95_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-95.png">95</a>]</span>
blood, and nothing good could come
to tho&#383;e who harboured me.'</p>

<p>"My &#383;ituation was, of cour&#383;e, di&#383;covered,
and &#383;he declared that I &#383;hould
not &#383;tay another night under the &#383;ame
roof with an hone&#383;t family. I was
therefore pu&#383;hed out of doors, and my
trumpery thrown after me, when it had
been contemptuou&#383;ly examined in the
pa&#383;&#383;age, le&#383;t I &#383;hould have &#383;tolen any
thing.</p>

<p>"Behold me then in the &#383;treet, utterly
de&#383;titute! Whither could I creep for
&#383;helter? To my father's roof I had no
claim, when not pur&#383;ued by &#383;hame&mdash;now
I &#383;hrunk back as from death, from
my mother's cruel reproaches, my father's
execrations. I could not endure
to hear him cur&#383;e the day I was born,
though life had been a cur&#383;e to me. Of
death I thought, but with a confu&#383;ed<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-96_S" id="APg_1-96_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-96.png">96</a>]</span>
emotion of terror, as I &#383;tood leaning
my head on a po&#383;t, and &#383;tarting at every
foot&#383;tep, le&#383;t it &#383;hould be my mi&#383;tre&#383;s
coming to tear my heart out. One of
the boys of the &#383;hop pa&#383;&#383;ing by, heard
my tale, and immediately repaired to
his ma&#383;ter, to give him a de&#383;cription of
my &#383;ituation; and he touched the right
key&mdash;the &#383;candal it would give ri&#383;e to,
if I were left to repeat my tale to every
enquirer. This plea came home to his
rea&#383;on, who had been &#383;obered by his
wife's rage, the fury of which fell on
him when I was out of her reach, and
he &#383;ent the boy to me with half-a-guinea,
de&#383;iring him to conduct me to a
hou&#383;e, where beggars, and other
wretches, the refu&#383;e of &#383;ociety, nightly
lodged.</p>

<p>"This night was &#383;pent in a &#383;tate of
&#383;tupefaction, or de&#383;peration. I dete&#383;ted
mankind, and abhorred my&#383;elf.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-97_S" id="APg_1-97_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-97.png">97</a>]</span>
"In the morning I ventured out, to
throw my&#383;elf in my ma&#383;ter's way, at his
u&#383;ual hour of going abroad. I approached
him, he 'damned me for a
b&mdash;&mdash;, declared I had di&#383;turbed the
peace of the family, and that he had
&#383;worn to his wife, never to take any
more notice of me.' He left me; but,
in&#383;tantly returning, he told me that he
&#383;hould &#383;peak to his friend, a pari&#383;h-officer,
to get a nur&#383;e for the brat I laid
to him; and advi&#383;ed me, if I wi&#383;hed to
keep out of the hou&#383;e of correction, not
to make free with his name.</p>

<p>"I hurried back to my hole, and, rage
giving place to de&#383;pair, &#383;ought for the
potion that was to procure abortion, and
&#383;wallowed it, with a wi&#383;h that it might
de&#383;troy me, at the &#383;ame time that it
&#383;topped the &#383;en&#383;ations of new-born life,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-98_S" id="APg_1-98_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-98.png">98</a>]</span>
which I felt with inde&#383;cribable emotion.
My head turned round, my heart grew
&#383;ick, and in the horrors of approaching
di&#383;&#383;olution, mental angui&#383;h was &#383;wallowed
up. The effect of the medicine
was violent, and I was confined to my
bed &#383;everal days; but, youth and a
&#383;trong con&#383;titution prevailing, I once
more crawled out, to a&#383;k my&#383;elf the
cruel que&#383;tion, 'Whither I &#383;hould
go?' I had but two &#383;hillings left in
my pocket, the re&#383;t had been expended,
by a poor woman who &#383;lept in the
&#383;ame room, to pay for my lodging,
and purcha&#383;e the nece&#383;&#383;aries of which
&#383;he partook.</p>

<p>"With this wretch I went into the
neighbouring &#383;treets to beg, and my
di&#383;con&#383;olate appearance drew a few
pence from the idle, enabling me &#383;till
to command a bed; till, recovering<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-99_S" id="APg_1-99_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-99.png">99</a>]</span>
from my illne&#383;s, and taught to put on
my rags to the be&#383;t advantage, I was
acco&#383;ted from different motives, and
yielded to the de&#383;ire of the brutes I met,
with the &#383;ame dete&#383;tation that I had
felt for my &#383;till more brutal ma&#383;ter.
I have &#383;ince read in novels of the blandi&#383;hments
of &#383;eduction, but I had not
even the plea&#383;ure of being enticed
into vice.</p>

<p>"I &#383;hall not," interrupted Jemima,
"lead your imagination into all the
&#383;cenes of wretchedne&#383;s and depravity,
which I was condemned to view; or
mark the different &#383;tages of my deba&#383;ing
mi&#383;ery. Fate dragged me
through the very kennels of &#383;ociety;
I was &#383;till a &#383;lave, a ba&#383;tard, a common
property. Become familiar with vice,
for I wi&#383;h to conceal nothing from you,
I picked the pockets of the drunkards<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-100_S" id="APg_1-100_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-100.png">100</a>]</span>
who abu&#383;ed me; and proved by my
conduct, that I de&#383;erved the epithets,
with which they loaded me at moments
when di&#383;tru&#383;t ought to cea&#383;e.</p>

<p>"Dete&#383;ting my nightly occupation,
though valuing, if I may &#383;o u&#383;e the
word, my independence, which only
con&#383;i&#383;ted in choo&#383;ing the &#383;treet in which
I &#383;hould wander, or the roof, when I
had money, in which I &#383;hould hide my
head, I was &#383;ome time before I could
prevail on my&#383;elf to accept of a place
in a hou&#383;e of ill fame, to which a girl,
with whom I had accidentally conver&#383;ed
in the &#383;treet, had recommended
me. I had been hunted almo&#383;t into a
a fever, by the watchmen of the quarter
of the town I frequented; one,
whom I had unwittingly offended, giving
the word to the whole pack. You
can &#383;carcely conceive the tyranny ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-101_S" id="APg_1-101_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-101.png">101</a>]</span>erci&#383;ed
by the&#383;e wretches: con&#383;idering
them&#383;elves as the in&#383;truments of
the very laws they violate, the pretext
which &#383;teels their con&#383;cience, hardens
their heart. Not content with receiving
from us, outlaws of &#383;ociety (let
other women talk of favours) a brutal
gratification gratuitou&#383;ly as a privilege
of office, they extort a tithe of pro&#383;titution,
and harra&#383;s with threats the
poor creatures who&#383;e occupation affords
not the means to &#383;ilence the growl of
avarice. To e&#383;cape from this per&#383;ecution,
I once more entered into &#383;ervitude.</p>

<p>"A life of comparative regularity
re&#383;tored my health; and&mdash;do not &#383;tart&mdash;my
manners were improved, in a &#383;ituation
where vice &#383;ought to render it&#383;elf
alluring, and ta&#383;te was cultivated to
fa&#383;hion the per&#383;on, if not to refine the
mind. Be&#383;ides, the common civility of<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-102_S" id="APg_1-102_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-102.png">102</a>]</span>
&#383;peech, contra&#383;ted with the gro&#383;s vulgarity
to which I had been accu&#383;tomed,
was &#383;omething like the poli&#383;h of civilization.
I was not &#383;hut out from all intercour&#383;e
of humanity. Still I was galled
by the yoke of &#383;ervice, and my mi&#383;tre&#383;s
often flying into violent fits of pa&#383;&#383;ion,
made me dread a &#383;udden di&#383;mi&#383;&#383;ion,
which I under&#383;tood was always the
ca&#383;e. I was therefore prevailed on,
though I felt a horror of men, to accept
the offer of a gentleman, rather in the
decline of years, to keep his hou&#383;e,
plea&#383;antly &#383;ituated in a little village
near Hamp&#383;tead.</p>

<p>"He was a man of great talents, and
of brilliant wit; but, a worn-out votary
of voluptuou&#383;ne&#383;s, his de&#383;ires became
fa&#383;tidious in proportion as they
grew weak, and the native tenderne&#383;s
of his heart was undermined by a vi<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-103_S" id="APg_1-103_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-103.png">103</a>]</span>tiated

of libertini&#383;m and &#383;ocial enjoyment,
had injured his health to &#383;uch a
degree, that, whatever plea&#383;ure his conver&#383;ation
afforded me (and my e&#383;teem
was en&#383;ured by proofs of the generous

his mi&#383;tre&#383;s was purcha&#383;ing it at a very
dear rate. With &#383;uch a keen perception
of the delicacies of &#383;entiment,
with an imagination invigorated by
the exerci&#383;e of genius, how could he
&#383;ink into the gro&#383;&#383;ne&#383;s of &#383;en&#383;uality!</p>

<p>"But, to pa&#383;s over a &#383;ubject which I
recollect with pain, I mu&#383;t remark to
you, as an an&#383;wer to your often-repeated
que&#383;tion, 'Why my &#383;entiments and
language were &#383;uperior to my &#383;tation?'
that I now began to read, to beguile
the tediou&#383;ne&#383;s of &#383;olitude, and to
gratify an inqui&#383;itive, active mind. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-104_S" id="APg_1-104_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-104.png">104</a>]</span>
had often, in my childhood, followed a
ballad-&#383;inger, to hear the &#383;equel of a
di&#383;mal &#383;tory, though &#383;ure of being &#383;everely
puni&#383;hed for delaying to return
with whatever I was &#383;ent to purcha&#383;e. I
could ju&#383;t &#383;pell and put a &#383;entence together,
and I li&#383;tened to the various arguments,
though often mingled with
ob&#383;cenity, which occurred at the table
where I was allowed to pre&#383;ide: for a
literary friend or two frequently came
home with my ma&#383;ter, to dine and pa&#383;s
the night. Having lo&#383;t the privileged re&#383;pect
of my &#383;ex, my pre&#383;ence, in&#383;tead
of re&#383;training, perhaps gave the reins
to their tongues; &#383;till I had the advantage
of hearing di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ions, from which,
in the common cour&#383;e of life, women
are excluded.</p>

<p>"You may ea&#383;ily imagine, that it
was only by degrees that I could com<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-105_S" id="APg_1-105_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-105.png">105</a>]</span>prehend
&#383;ome of the &#383;ubjects they inve&#383;tigated,
or acquire from their rea&#383;oning
what might be termed a moral
&#383;en&#383;e. But my fondne&#383;s of reading increa&#383;ing,
and my ma&#383;ter occa&#383;ionally
&#383;hutting him&#383;elf up in this retreat, for
weeks together, to write, I had many
opportunities of improvement. At
fir&#383;t, con&#383;idering money <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '(I was right!&quot; exclaimed'">I was right!" (</ins>exclaimed Jemima, altering her tone of
voice) "as the only means, after my lo&#383;s
of reputation, of obtaining re&#383;pect, or
even the toleration of humanity, I had
not the lea&#383;t &#383;cruple to &#383;ecrete a part of
the &#383;ums intru&#383;ted to me, and to &#383;creen
my&#383;elf from detection by a &#383;y&#383;tem of
fal&#383;hood. But, acquiring new principles,
I began to have the ambition of
returning to the re&#383;pectable part of &#383;ociety,
and was weak enough to &#383;uppo&#383;e
it po&#383;&#383;ible. The attention of my una&#383;<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-106_S" id="APg_1-106_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-106.png">106</a>]</span>&#383;uming
in&#383;tructor, who, without being
ignorant of his own powers, po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed
great &#383;implicity of manners, &#383;trengthened
the illu&#383;ion. Having &#383;ometimes
caught up hints for thought, from my
untutored remarks, he often led me to
di&#383;cu&#383;s the &#383;ubjects he was treating,
and would read to me his productions,
previous to their publication, wi&#383;hing
to profit by the critici&#383;m of un&#383;ophi&#383;ticated
feeling. The aim of his writings
was to touch the &#383;imple &#383;prings of
the heart; for he de&#383;pi&#383;ed the would-be
oracles, the &#383;elf-elected philo&#383;ophers,
who fright away fancy, while &#383;ifting
each grain of thought to prove that
&#383;lowne&#383;s of comprehen&#383;ion is wi&#383;dom.</p>

<p>"I &#383;hould have di&#383;tingui&#383;hed this as
a moment of &#383;un&#383;hine, a happy period
in my life, had not the repugnance the
di&#383;gu&#383;ting libertini&#383;m of my protector<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-107_S" id="APg_1-107_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-107.png">107</a>]</span>
in&#383;pired, daily become more painful.&mdash;And,
indeed, I &#383;oon did recollect it as
&#383;uch with agony, when his &#383;udden
death (for he had recour&#383;e to the mo&#383;t
exhilarating cordials to keep up the
convivial tone of his &#383;pirits) again
threw me into the de&#383;ert of human &#383;ociety.
Had he had any time for reflection,
I am certain he would have
left the little property in his power to
me: but, attacked by the fatal apoplexy
in town, his heir, a man of
rigid morals, brought his wife with
him to take po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of the hou&#383;e and
effects, before I was even informed of
his death,&mdash;'to prevent,' as &#383;he took
care indirectly to tell me, '&#383;uch a
creature as &#383;he &#383;uppo&#383;ed me to be, from
purloining any of them, had I been
apprized of the event in time.'</p>

<p>"The grief I felt at the &#383;udden<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-108_S" id="APg_1-108_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-108.png">108</a>]</span>
&#383;hock the information gave me, which
at fir&#383;t had nothing &#383;elfi&#383;h in it, was
treated with contempt, and I was ordered
to pack up my clothes; and a few
trinkets and books, given me by the
generous decea&#383;ed, were conte&#383;ted,
while they piou&#383;ly hoped, with a reprobating
&#383;hake of the head, 'that
God would have mercy on his &#383;inful
&#383;oul!' With &#383;ome difficulty, I obtained
my arrears of wages; but a&#383;king&mdash;&#383;uch
is the &#383;pirit-grinding con&#383;equence
of poverty and infamy&mdash;for a character
for hone&#383;ty and economy, which God
knows I merited, I was told by this&mdash;why
mu&#383;t I call her woman?&mdash;'that
it would go again&#383;t her con&#383;cience to
recommend a kept mi&#383;tre&#383;s.' Tears
&#383;tarted in my eyes, burning tears; for
there are &#383;ituations in which a wretch<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-109_S" id="APg_1-109_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-109.png">109</a>]</span>
is humbled by the contempt they are
con&#383;cious they do not de&#383;erve.</p>

<p>"I returned to the metropolis; but
the &#383;olitude of a poor lodging was inconceivably
dreary, after the &#383;ociety I
had enjoyed. To be cut off from human
conver&#383;e, now I had been taught
to reli&#383;h it, was to wander a gho&#383;t
among the living. Be&#383;ides, I fore&#383;aw, to
aggravate the &#383;everity of my fate, that
my little pittance would &#383;oon melt
away. I endeavoured to obtain needlework;
but, not having been taught early,
and my hands being rendered clum&#383;y
by hard work, I did not &#383;ufficiently excel
to be employed by the ready-made
linen &#383;hops, when &#383;o many women,
better qualified, were &#383;uing for it.
The want of a character prevented my
getting a place; for, irk&#383;ome as &#383;ervitude
would have been to me, I &#383;hould<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-110_S" id="APg_1-110_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-110.png">110</a>]</span>
have made another trial, had it been
fea&#383;ible. Not that I di&#383;liked employment,
but the inequality of condition
to which I mu&#383;t have &#383;ubmitted.
I had acquired a ta&#383;te for literature,
during the five years I had lived with
a literary man, occa&#383;ionally conver&#383;ing
with men of the fir&#383;t abilities of the
age; and now to de&#383;cend to the lowe&#383;t
vulgarity, was a degree of wretchedne&#383;s
not to be imagined unfelt. I had
not, it is true, ta&#383;ted the charms of affection,
but I had been familiar with
the graces of humanity.</p>

<p>"One of the gentlemen, whom I
had frequently dined in company with,
while I was treated like a companion,
met me in the &#383;treet, and enquired
after my health. I &#383;eized the occa&#383;ion,
and began to de&#383;cribe my &#383;ituation;
but he was in ha&#383;te to join, at dinner,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-111_S" id="APg_1-111_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-111.png">111</a>]</span>
a &#383;elect party of choice &#383;pirits; therefore,
without waiting to hear me, he
impatiently put a guinea into my hand,
&#383;aying, 'It was a pity &#383;uch a &#383;en&#383;ible
woman &#383;hould be in di&#383;tre&#383;s&mdash;he wi&#383;hed
me well from his &#383;oul.'</p>

<p>"To another I wrote, &#383;tating my ca&#383;e,
and reque&#383;ting advice. He was an advocate
for unequivocal &#383;incerity; and
had often, in my pre&#383;ence, de&#383;canted
on the evils which ari&#383;e in &#383;ociety from
the de&#383;poti&#383;m of rank and riches.</p>

<p>"In reply, I received a long e&#383;&#383;ay on
the energy of the human mind, with
continual allu&#383;ions to his own force of
character. He added, 'That the woman
who could write &#383;uch a letter as I
had &#383;ent him, could never be in want
of re&#383;ources, were &#383;he to look into her&#383;elf,
and exert her powers; mi&#383;ery was
the con&#383;equence of indolence, and, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-112_S" id="APg_1-112_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-112.png">112</a>]</span>
to my being &#383;hut out from &#383;ociety, it
was the lot of man to &#383;ubmit to certain
privations.'</p>

<p>"How often have I heard," &#383;aid
Jemima, interrupting her narrative,
"in conver&#383;ation, and read in books,
that every per&#383;on willing to work may
find employment? It is the vague a&#383;&#383;ertion,
I believe, of in&#383;en&#383;ible indolence,
when it relates to men; but, with
re&#383;pect to women, I am &#383;ure of its fallacy,
unle&#383;s they will &#383;ubmit to the
mo&#383;t menial bodily labour; and even
to be employed at hard labour is out of
the reach of many, who&#383;e reputation
mi&#383;fortune or folly has tainted.</p>

<p>"How writers, profe&#383;&#383;ing to be friends
to freedom, and the improvement of
morals, can a&#383;&#383;ert that poverty is no
evil, I cannot imagine."</p>

<p>"No more can I," interrupted Ma<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-113_S" id="APg_1-113_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-113.png">113</a>]</span>ria,
"yet they even expatiate on the
peculiar happine&#383;s of indigence, though
in what it can con&#383;i&#383;t, excepting in
brutal re&#383;t, when a man can barely earn
a &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence, I cannot imagine. The
mind is nece&#383;&#383;arily impri&#383;oned in its
own little tenement; and, fully occupied
by keeping it in repair, has not
time to rove abroad for improvement.
The book of knowledge is clo&#383;ely
cla&#383;ped, again&#383;t tho&#383;e who mu&#383;t fulfil
their daily ta&#383;k of &#383;evere manual labour
or die; and curio&#383;ity, rarely excited by
thought or information, &#383;eldom moves
on the &#383;tagnate lake of ignorance."</p>

<p>"As far as I have been able to ob&#383;erve,"
replied Jemima, "prejudices,
caught up by chance, are ob&#383;tinately
maintained by the poor, to the exclu&#383;ion
of improvement; they have not
time to rea&#383;on or reflect to any extent,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-114_S" id="APg_1-114_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-114.png">114</a>]</span>
or minds &#383;ufficiently exerci&#383;ed to adopt
the principles of action, which form
perhaps the only ba&#383;is of contentment
in every &#383;tation<a name="AFNanchor_114-A_5_S" id="AFNanchor_114-A_5_S"></a><a href="#AFootnote_114-A_5_S" class="fnanchor">[114-A]</a>."</p>

<hr />

<p>"And independence," &#383;aid Darnford,
"they are nece&#383;&#383;arily &#383;trangers to,
even the independence of de&#383;pi&#383;ing their
per&#383;ecutors. If the poor are happy, or
can be happy, <i>things are very well as they
are</i>. And I cannot conceive on what
principle tho&#383;e writers contend for a
change of &#383;y&#383;tem, who &#383;upport this
opinion. The authors on the other
&#383;ide of the que&#383;tion are much more
con&#383;i&#383;tent, who grant the fact; yet, in&#383;i&#383;ting
that it is the lot of the majority<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-115_S" id="APg_1-115_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-115.png">115</a>]</span>
to be oppre&#383;&#383;ed in this life, kindly turn
them over to another, to rectify the
fal&#383;e weights and mea&#383;ures of this, as
the only way to ju&#383;tify the di&#383;pen&#383;ations
of Providence. I have not," continued
Darnford, "an opinion more firmly
fixed by ob&#383;ervation in my mind, than
that, though riches may fail to produce
proportionate happine&#383;s, poverty mo&#383;t
commonly excludes it, by &#383;hutting up
all the avenues to improvement."</p>

<p>"And as for the affections," added
Maria, with a &#383;igh, "how gro&#383;s, and
even tormenting do they become, unle&#383;s
regulated by an improving mind!
The culture of the heart ever, I believe,
keeps pace with that of the
mind. But pray go on," addre&#383;&#383;ing
Jemima, "though your narrative gives
ri&#383;e to the mo&#383;t painful reflections on
the pre&#383;ent &#383;tate of &#383;ociety."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-116_S" id="APg_1-116_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-116.png">116</a>]</span>
"Not to trouble you," continued
&#383;he, "with a detailed de&#383;cription of all
the painful feelings of unavailing exertion,
I have only to tell you, that at
la&#383;t I got recommended to wa&#383;h in a
few families, who did me the favour
to admit me into their hou&#383;es, without
the mo&#383;t &#383;trict enquiry, to wa&#383;h from
one in the morning till eight at night,
for eighteen or twenty-pence a day.
On the happine&#383;s to be enjoyed over a
wa&#383;hing-tub I need not comment; yet
you will allow me to ob&#383;erve, that this
was a wretchedne&#383;s of &#383;ituation peculiar
to my &#383;ex. A man with half my indu&#383;try,
and, I may &#383;ay, abilities, could
have procured a decent livelihood, and
di&#383;charged &#383;ome of the duties which
knit mankind together; whil&#383;t I, who
had acquired a ta&#383;te for the rational, nay,
in hone&#383;t pride let me a&#383;&#383;ert it, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-117_S" id="APg_1-117_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-117.png">117</a>]</span>
virtuous enjoyments of life, was ca&#383;t
a&#383;ide as the filth of &#383;ociety. Condemned
to labour, like a machine, only
to earn bread, and &#383;carcely that, I became
melancholy and de&#383;perate.</p>

<p>"I have now to mention a circum&#383;tance
which fills me with remor&#383;e, and
fear it will entirely deprive me of your
e&#383;teem. A trade&#383;man became attached
to me, and vi&#383;ited me frequently,&mdash;and
I at la&#383;t obtained &#383;uch a power over
him, that he offered to take me home
to his hou&#383;e.&mdash;Con&#383;ider, dear madam,
I was fami&#383;hing: wonder not that I became
a wolf!&mdash;The only rea&#383;on for not
taking me home immediately, was the
having a girl in the hou&#383;e, with child
by him&mdash;and this girl&mdash;I advi&#383;ed him&mdash;yes,
I did! would I could forget it!&mdash;to
turn out of doors: and one night he
determined to follow my advice, Poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-118_S" id="APg_1-118_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-118.png">118</a>]</span>
wretch! &#383;he fell upon her knees, reminded
him that he had promi&#383;ed to
marry her, that her parents were hone&#383;t!&mdash;What
did it avail?&mdash;She was turned
out.</p>

<p>"She approached her father's door,
in the &#383;kirts of London,&mdash;li&#383;tened at
the &#383;hutters,&mdash;but could not knock. A
watchman had ob&#383;erved her go and
return &#383;everal times&mdash;Poor wretch!&mdash;<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Errata: original reads '['">"</ins> The
remor&#383;e Jemima &#383;poke of, &#383;eemed
to be &#383;tinging her to the &#383;oul, as &#383;he
proceeded.<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Errata: original reads ']'">"</ins></p>

<p>"She left it, and, approaching a
tub where hor&#383;es were watered, &#383;he
&#383;at down in it, and, with de&#383;perate re&#383;olution,
remained in that attitude&mdash;till
re&#383;olution was no longer nece&#383;&#383;ary!</p>

<p>"I happened that morning to be
going out to wa&#383;h, anticipating the
moment when I &#383;hould e&#383;cape from<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-119_S" id="APg_1-119_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-119.png">119</a>]</span>
&#383;uch hard labour. I pa&#383;&#383;ed by, ju&#383;t as
&#383;ome men, going to work, drew out
the &#383;tiff, cold corp&#383;e&mdash;Let me not recal
the horrid moment!&mdash;I recognized
her pale vi&#383;age; I li&#383;tened to the tale
told by the &#383;pectators, and my heart
did not bur&#383;t. I thought of my own
&#383;tate, and wondered how I could be
&#383;uch a mon&#383;ter!&mdash;I worked hard; and,
returning home, I was attacked by a
fever. I &#383;uffered both in body and mind.
I determined not to live with the
wretch. But he did not try me; he
left the neighbourhood. I once more
returned to the wa&#383;h-tub.</p>

<p>"Still this &#383;tate, mi&#383;erable as it was,
admitted of aggravation. Lifting one
day a heavy load, a tub fell again&#383;t my
&#383;hin, and gave me great pain. I did
not pay much attention to the hurt,
till it became a &#383;erious wound; being<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-120_S" id="APg_1-120_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-120.png">120</a>]</span>
obliged to work as u&#383;ual, or &#383;tarve.
But, finding my&#383;elf at length unable
to &#383;tand for any time, I thought of
getting into an ho&#383;pital. Ho&#383;pitals, it
&#383;hould &#383;eem (for they are comfortle&#383;s
abodes for the &#383;ick) were expre&#383;&#383;ly endowed
for the reception of the friendle&#383;s;
yet I, who had on that plea a
right to a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance, wanted the recommendation
of the rich and re&#383;pectable,
and was &#383;everal weeks langui&#383;hing for admittance;
fees were demanded on entering;
and, what was &#383;till more unrea&#383;onable,
&#383;ecurity for burying me, that expence
not coming into the letter of the
charity. A guinea was the &#383;tipulated &#383;um&mdash;I
could as &#383;oon have rai&#383;ed a million;
and I was afraid to apply to the pari&#383;h
for an order, le&#383;t they &#383;hould have
pa&#383;&#383;ed me, I knew not whither. The
poor woman at who&#383;e hou&#383;e I lodged,
compa&#383;&#383;ionating my &#383;tate, got me into<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-121_S" id="APg_1-121_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-121.png">121</a>]</span>
the ho&#383;pital; and the family where I
received the hurt, &#383;ent me five &#383;hillings,
three and &#383;ix-pence of which I gave at
my admittance&mdash;I know not for what.</p>

<p>"My leg grew quickly better; but
I was di&#383;mi&#383;&#383;ed before my cure was
completed, becau&#383;e I could not afford
to have my linen wa&#383;hed to appear decently,
as the virago of a nur&#383;e &#383;aid,
when the gentlemen (the &#383;urgeons)
came. I cannot give you an adequate
idea of the wretchedne&#383;s of an ho&#383;pital;
every thing is left to the care of people
intent on gain. The attendants &#383;eem
to have lo&#383;t all feeling of compa&#383;&#383;ion in
the bu&#383;tling di&#383;charge of their offices;
death is &#383;o familiar to them, that they
are not anxious to ward it off. Every
thing appeared to be conducted for the
accommodation of the medical men
and their pupils, who came to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-122_S" id="APg_1-122_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-122.png">122</a>]</span>
experiments on the poor, for the benefit
of the rich. One of the phy&#383;icians,
I mu&#383;t not forget to mention, gave me
half-a-crown, and ordered me &#383;ome
wine, when I was at the lowe&#383;t ebb. I
thought of making my ca&#383;e known to
the lady-like matron; but her forbidding
countenance prevented me. She
conde&#383;cended to look on the patients,
and make general enquiries, two or
three times a week; but the nur&#383;es
knew the hour when the vi&#383;it of ceremony
would commence, and every
thing was as it &#383;hould be.</p>

<p>"After my di&#383;mi&#383;&#383;ion, I was more at
a lo&#383;s than ever for a &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence, and,
not to weary you with a repetition of
the &#383;ame unavailing attempts, unable
to &#383;tand at the wa&#383;hing-tub, I began to
con&#383;ider the rich and poor as natural
enemies, and became a thief from prin<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-123_S" id="APg_1-123_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-123.png">123</a>]</span>ciple.
I could not now cea&#383;e to rea&#383;on,
but I hated mankind. I de&#383;pi&#383;ed my&#383;elf,
yet I ju&#383;tified my conduct. I was
taken, tried, and condemned to &#383;ix
months' impri&#383;onment in a hou&#383;e of
correction. My &#383;oul recoils with horror
from the remembrance of the in&#383;ults I
had to endure, till, branded with &#383;hame,
I was turned loo&#383;e in the &#383;treet, pennyle&#383;s.
I wandered from &#383;treet to &#383;treet,
till, exhau&#383;ted by hunger and fatigue, I
&#383;unk down &#383;en&#383;ele&#383;s at a door, where
I had vainly demanded a mor&#383;el of
bread. I was &#383;ent by the inhabitant to
the work-hou&#383;e, to which he had &#383;urlily
bid me go, &#383;aying, he 'paid enough
in con&#383;cience to the poor,' when, with
parched tongue, I implored his charity.
If tho&#383;e well-meaning people who exclaim
again&#383;t beggars, were acquainted
with the treatment the poor receive in<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-124_S" id="APg_1-124_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-124.png">124</a>]</span>
many of the&#383;e wretched a&#383;ylums, they
would not &#383;tifle &#383;o ea&#383;ily involuntary
&#383;ympathy, by &#383;aying that they have all
pari&#383;hes to go to, or wonder that the
poor dread to enter the gloomy walls.
What are the common run of work-hou&#383;es,
but pri&#383;ons, in which many
re&#383;pectable old people, worn out by
immoderate labour, &#383;ink into the grave
in &#383;orrow, to which they are carried
like dogs!"</p>

<p>Alarmed by &#383;ome indi&#383;tinct noi&#383;e,
Jemima ro&#383;e ha&#383;tily to li&#383;ten, and Maria,
turning to Darnford, &#383;aid, "I have indeed
been &#383;hocked beyond expre&#383;&#383;ion
when I have met a pauper's funeral. A
coffin carried on the &#383;houlders of three
or four ill-looking wretches, whom the
imagination might ea&#383;ily convert into a
band of a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ins, ha&#383;tening to conceal
the corp&#383;e, and quarrelling about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-125_S" id="APg_1-125_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-125.png">125</a>]</span>
prey on their way. I know it is of
little con&#383;equence how we are con&#383;igned
to the earth; but I am led by
this brutal in&#383;en&#383;ibility, to what even
the animal creation appears forcibly to
feel, to advert to the wretched, de&#383;erted
manner in which they died."</p>

<p>"True," rejoined Darnford, "and,
till the rich will give more than a part
of their wealth, till they will give time
and attention to the wants of the di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;ed,
never let them boa&#383;t of charity.
Let them open their hearts, and not
their pur&#383;es, and employ their minds
in the &#383;ervice, if they are really actuated
by humanity; or charitable in&#383;titutions
will always be the prey of the
lowe&#383;t order of knaves."</p>

<p>Jemima returning, &#383;eemed in ha&#383;te
to fini&#383;h her tale. "The over&#383;eer
farmed the poor of different pari&#383;hes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-126_S" id="APg_1-126_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-126.png">126</a>]</span>
and out of the bowels of poverty was
wrung the money with which he purcha&#383;ed
this dwelling, as a private receptacle
for madne&#383;s. He had been
a keeper at a hou&#383;e of the &#383;ame de&#383;cription,
and conceived that he could
make money much more readily in his
old occupation. He is a &#383;hrewd&mdash;&#383;hall
I &#383;ay it?&mdash;villain. He ob&#383;erved &#383;omething
re&#383;olute in my manner, and offered
to take me with him, and in&#383;truct
me how to treat the di&#383;turbed minds he
meant to intru&#383;t to my care. The
offer of forty pounds a year, and to quit
a workhou&#383;e, was not to be de&#383;pi&#383;ed,
though the condition of &#383;hutting my
eyes and hardening my heart was annexed
to it.</p>

<p>"I agreed to accompany him; and
four years have I been attendant on
many wretches, and"&mdash;&#383;he lowered<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-127_S" id="APg_1-127_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-127.png">127</a>]</span>
her voice,&mdash;"the witne&#383;s of many
enormities. In &#383;olitude my mind
&#383;eemed to recover its force, and many
of the &#383;entiments which I imbibed in
the only tolerable period of my life, returned
with their full force. Still
what &#383;hould induce me to be the champion
for &#383;uffering humanity?&mdash;Who
ever ri&#383;ked any thing for me?&mdash;Who
ever acknowledged me to be a fellow-creature?"&mdash;</p>

<p>Maria took her hand, and Jemima,
more overcome by kindne&#383;s than &#383;he
had ever been by cruelty, ha&#383;tened out
of the room to conceal her emotions.</p>

<p>Darnford &#383;oon after heard his &#383;ummons,
and, taking leave of him, Maria
promi&#383;ed to gratify his curio&#383;ity,
with re&#383;pect to her&#383;elf, the fir&#383;t
opportunity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Active</span> as love was in the heart
of Maria, the &#383;tory &#383;he had ju&#383;t heard
made her thoughts take a wider range.
The opening buds of hope clo&#383;ed, as
if they had put forth too early, and the
the happie&#383;t day of her life was overca&#383;t
by the mo&#383;t melancholy reflections.
Thinking of Jemima's peculiar fate
and her own, &#383;he was led to con&#383;ider
the oppre&#383;&#383;ed &#383;tate of women, and to
lament that &#383;he had given birth to a
daughter. Sleep fled from her eyelids,
while &#383;he dwelt on the wretchedne&#383;s
of unprotected infancy, till &#383;ympathy
with Jemima changed to agony,
when it &#383;eemed probable that her own<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-129_S" id="APg_1-129_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-129.png">129</a>]</span>
babe might even now be in the very
&#383;tate &#383;he &#383;o forcibly de&#383;cribed.</p>

<p>Maria thought, and thought again.
Jemima's humanity had rather been
benumbed than killed, by the keen
fro&#383;t &#383;he had to brave at her entrance
into life; an appeal then to her feelings,
on this tender point, &#383;urely
would not be fruitle&#383;s; and Maria began
to anticipate the delight it would
afford her to gain intelligence of her
child. This project was now the only
&#383;ubject of reflection; and &#383;he watched
impatiently for the dawn of day, with
that determinate purpo&#383;e which generally
in&#383;ures &#383;ucce&#383;s.</p>

<p>At the u&#383;ual hour, Jemima brought
her breakfa&#383;t, and a tender note from
Darnford. She ran her eye ha&#383;tily over
it, and her heart calmly hoarded up
the rapture a fre&#383;h a&#383;&#383;urance of affec<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-130_S" id="APg_1-130_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-130.png">130</a>]</span>tion,
affection &#383;uch as &#383;he wi&#383;hed to
in&#383;pire, gave her, without diverting her
mind a moment from its de&#383;ign. While
Jemima waited to take away the
breakfa&#383;t, Maria alluded to the reflections,
that had haunted her during the
night to the exclu&#383;ion of &#383;leep. She
&#383;poke with energy of Jemima's unmerited
&#383;ufferings, and of the fate of a
number of de&#383;erted females, placed
within the &#383;weep of a whirlwind, from
which it was next to impo&#383;&#383;ible to
e&#383;cape. Perceiving the effect her conver&#383;ation
produced on the countenance
of her guard, &#383;he gra&#383;ped the arm of
Jemima with that irre&#383;i&#383;tible warmth
which defies repul&#383;e, exclaiming&mdash;"With
your heart, and &#383;uch dreadful
experience, can you lend your aid to
deprive my babe of a mother's tenderne&#383;s,
a mother's care? In the name<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-131_S" id="APg_1-131_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-131.png">131</a>]</span>
of God, a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t me to &#383;natch her from
de&#383;truction! Let me but give her an
education&mdash;let me but prepare her
body and mind to encounter the ills
which await her &#383;ex, and I will teach
her to con&#383;ider you as her &#383;econd mother,
and her&#383;elf as the prop of your
age. Yes, Jemima, look at me&mdash;ob&#383;erve
me clo&#383;ely, and read my very &#383;oul;
you merit a better fate;" &#383;he held out
her hand with a firm ge&#383;ture of a&#383;&#383;urance;
"and I will procure it for you,
as a te&#383;timony of my e&#383;teem, as well as
of my gratitude."</p>

<p>Jemima had not power to re&#383;i&#383;t this
per&#383;ua&#383;ive torrent; and, owning that
the hou&#383;e in which &#383;he was confined,
was &#383;ituated on the banks of the
Thames, only a few miles from London,
and not on the &#383;ea-coa&#383;t, as Darnford
had &#383;uppo&#383;ed, &#383;he promi&#383;ed to in<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-132_S" id="APg_1-132_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-132.png">132</a>]</span>vent
&#383;ome excu&#383;e for her ab&#383;ence, and
go her&#383;elf to trace the &#383;ituation, and
enquire concerning the health, of this
abandoned daughter. Her manner
implied an intention to do &#383;omething
more, but &#383;he &#383;eemed unwilling to
impart her de&#383;ign; and Maria, glad to
have obtained the main point, thought
it be&#383;t to leave her to the workings of
her own mind; convinced that &#383;he had
the power of intere&#383;ting her &#383;till more
in favour of her&#383;elf and child, by a
&#383;imple recital of facts.</p>

<p>In the evening, Jemima informed the
impatient mother, that on the morrow
&#383;he &#383;hould ha&#383;ten to town before the family
hour of ri&#383;ing, and received all
the information nece&#383;&#383;ary, as a clue to
her &#383;earch. The "Good night!" Maria
uttered was peculiarly &#383;olemn and
affectionate. Glad expectation &#383;par<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-133_S" id="APg_1-133_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-133.png">133</a>]</span>kled
in her eye; and, for the fir&#383;t time
&#383;ince her detention, &#383;he pronounced
the name of her child with plea&#383;ureable
fondne&#383;s; and, with all the garrulity
of a nur&#383;e, de&#383;cribed her fir&#383;t
&#383;mile when &#383;he recognized her mother.
Recollecting her&#383;elf, a &#383;till
kinder "Adieu!" with a "God
ble&#383;s you!"&mdash;that &#383;eemed to include
a maternal benediction, di&#383;mi&#383;&#383;ed
Jemima.</p>

<p>The dreary &#383;olitude of the en&#383;uing
day, lengthened by impatiently dwelling
on the &#383;ame idea, was intolerably
weari&#383;ome. She li&#383;tened for the &#383;ound
of a particular clock, which &#383;ome directions
of the wind allowed her to
hear di&#383;tinctly. She marked the &#383;hadow
gaining on the wall; and, twilight
thickening into darkne&#383;s, her breath
&#383;eemed oppre&#383;&#383;ed while &#383;he anxiou&#383;ly<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-134_S" id="APg_1-134_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-134.png">134</a>]</span>
counted nine.&mdash;The la&#383;t &#383;ound was a
&#383;troke of de&#383;pair on her heart; for &#383;he
expected every moment, without &#383;eeing
Jemima, to have her light extingui&#383;hed
by the &#383;avage female who &#383;upplied
her place. She was even obliged
to prepare for bed, re&#383;tle&#383;s as &#383;he was,
not to di&#383;oblige her new attendant.
She had been cautioned not to &#383;peak
too freely to her; but the caution was
needle&#383;s, her countenance would &#383;till
more emphatically have made her
&#383;hrink back. Such was the ferocity of
manner, con&#383;picuous in every word
and ge&#383;ture of this hag, that Maria was
afraid to enquire, why Jemima, who
had faithfully promi&#383;ed to &#383;ee her before
her door was &#383;hut for the night, came
not?&mdash;and, when the key turned in the
lock, to con&#383;ign her to a night of &#383;u&#383;pence,
&#383;he felt a degree of angui&#383;h<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-135_S" id="APg_1-135_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-135.png">135</a>]</span>
which the circum&#383;tances &#383;carcely ju&#383;tified.</p>

<p>Continually on the watch, the &#383;hutting
of a door, or the &#383;ound of a foot&#383;tep,
made her &#383;tart and tremble with
apprehen&#383;ion, &#383;omething like what &#383;he
felt, when, at her entrance, dragged
along the gallery, &#383;he began to doubt
whether &#383;he were not &#383;urrounded by
demons?</p>

<p>Fatigued by an endle&#383;s rotation of
thought and wild alarms, &#383;he looked
like a &#383;pectre, when Jemima entered
in the morning; e&#383;pecially as her eyes
darted out of her head, to read in Jemima's
countenance, almo&#383;t as pallid,
the intelligence &#383;he dared not tru&#383;t her
tongue to demand. Jemima put down
the tea-things, and appeared very bu&#383;y
in arranging the table. Maria took up
a cup with trembling hand, then for<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-136_S" id="APg_1-136_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-136.png">136</a>]</span>cibly
recovering her fortitude, and re&#383;training
the convul&#383;ive movement
which agitated the mu&#383;cles of her
mouth, &#383;he &#383;aid, "Spare your&#383;elf the
pain of preparing me for your information,
I adjure you!&mdash;My child is dead!"
Jemima &#383;olemnly an&#383;wered, "Yes;"
with a look expre&#383;&#383;ive of compa&#383;&#383;ion
and angry emotions. "Leave me,"
added Maria, making a fre&#383;h effort to
govern her feelings, and hiding her face
in her handkerchief, to conceal her angui&#383;h&mdash;"It
is enough&mdash;I know that my
babe is no more&mdash;I will hear the particulars
when I am"&mdash;<i>calmer</i>, &#383;he could not
utter; and Jemima, without importuning
her by idle attempts to con&#383;ole her,
left the room.</p>

<p>Plunged in the deepe&#383;t melancholy,
&#383;he would not admit Darnford's vi&#383;its;
and &#383;uch is the force of early a&#383;&#383;ocia<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-137_S" id="APg_1-137_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-137.png">137</a>]</span>tions
even on &#383;trong minds, that, for
a while, &#383;he indulged the &#383;uper&#383;titious
notion that &#383;he was ju&#383;tly puni&#383;hed by
the death of her child, for having for an
in&#383;tant cea&#383;ed to regret her lo&#383;s. Two
or three letters from Darnford, full of
&#383;oothing, manly tenderne&#383;s, only added
poignancy to the&#383;e accu&#383;ing emotions;
yet the pa&#383;&#383;ionate &#383;tyle in which he expre&#383;&#383;ed,
what he termed the fir&#383;t and
fonde&#383;t wi&#383;h of his heart, "that his affection
might make her &#383;ome amends
for the cruelty and inju&#383;tice &#383;he had endured,"
in&#383;pired a &#383;entiment of gratitude
to heaven; and her eyes filled
with delicious tears, when, at the conclu&#383;ion
of his letter, wi&#383;hing to &#383;upply
the place of her unworthy relations,
who&#383;e want of principle he execrated,
he a&#383;&#383;ured her, calling her his deare&#383;t
girl, "that it &#383;hould henceforth be the
bu&#383;ine&#383;s of his life to make her happy."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-138_S" id="APg_1-138_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-138.png">138</a>]</span>
He begged, in a note &#383;ent the following
morning, to be permitted to &#383;ee
her, when his pre&#383;ence would be no intru&#383;ion
on her grief; and &#383;o earne&#383;tly
intreated to be allowed, according to
promi&#383;e, to beguile the tedious moments
of ab&#383;ence, by dwelling on the
events of her pa&#383;t life, that &#383;he &#383;ent him

<p>"Born in one of the mo&#383;t romantic
parts of England, an enthu&#383;ia&#383;tic fondne&#383;s
for the varying charms of nature
is the fir&#383;t &#383;entiment I recollect; or rather
it was the fir&#383;t con&#383;ciou&#383;ne&#383;s of
plea&#383;ure that employed and formed my
imagination.</p>

<p>"My father had been a captain
of a man of war; but, di&#383;gu&#383;ted with
the &#383;ervice, on account of the pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-142_S" id="APg_1-142_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-142.png">142</a>]</span>ferment
of men who&#383;e chief merit was
their family connections or borough
intere&#383;t, he retired into the country;
and, not knowing what to do with
him&#383;elf&mdash;married. In his family, to
regain his lo&#383;t con&#383;equence, he determined
to keep up the &#383;ame pa&#383;&#383;ive obedience,
as in the ve&#383;&#383;els in which he had
commanded. His orders were not to be
di&#383;puted; and the whole hou&#383;e was expected
to fly, at the word of command,
as if to man the &#383;hrouds, or mount aloft
in an elemental &#383;trife, big with life or
death. He was to be in&#383;tantaneou&#383;ly
obeyed, e&#383;pecially by my mother, whom
he very benevolently married for love;
but took care to remind her of the obligation,
when &#383;he dared, in the &#383;lighte&#383;t
in&#383;tance, to que&#383;tion his ab&#383;olute authority.
My elde&#383;t brother, it is true, as
he grew up, was treated with more re<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-143_S" id="APg_1-143_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-143.png">143</a>]</span>&#383;pect
by my father; and became in due
form the deputy-tyrant of the hou&#383;e.
The repre&#383;entative of my father, a being
privileged by nature&mdash;a boy, and
the darling of my mother, he did not
fail to act like an heir apparent. Such
indeed was my mother's extravagant
partiality, that, in compari&#383;on with her
affection for him, &#383;he might be &#383;aid not
to love the re&#383;t of her children. Yet
none of the children &#383;eemed to have &#383;o
little affection for her. Extreme indulgence
had rendered him &#383;o &#383;elfi&#383;h,
that he only thought of him&#383;elf; and
from tormenting in&#383;ects and animals, he
became the de&#383;pot of his brothers, and
&#383;till more of his &#383;i&#383;ters.</p>

<p>"It is perhaps difficult to give you an
idea of the petty cares which ob&#383;cured
the morning of my life; continual re&#383;traint
in the mo&#383;t trivial matters; un<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-144_S" id="APg_1-144_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-144.png">144</a>]</span>conditional
&#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion to orders, which,
as a mere child, I &#383;oon di&#383;covered to be
unrea&#383;onable, becau&#383;e incon&#383;i&#383;tent and
contradictory. Thus are we de&#383;tined
to experience a mixture of bitterne&#383;s,
with the recollection of our mo&#383;t innocent
enjoyments.</p>

<p>"The circum&#383;tances which, during
my childhood, occurred to fa&#383;hion my
mind, were various; yet, as it would
probably afford me more plea&#383;ure to
revive the fading remembrance of new-born
delight, than you, my child, could
feel in the peru&#383;al, I will not entice
you to &#383;tray with me into the verdant
meadow, to &#383;earch for the flowers that
youthful hopes &#383;catter in every path;
though, as I write, I almo&#383;t &#383;cent the
fre&#383;h green of &#383;pring&mdash;of that &#383;pring
which never returns!</p>

<p>"I had two &#383;i&#383;ters, and one brother,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-145_S" id="APg_1-145_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-145.png">145</a>]</span>
younger than my&#383;elf; my brother Robert
was two years older, and might
truly be termed the idol of his parents,
and the torment of the re&#383;t of the family.
Such indeed is the force of prejudice,
that what was called &#383;pirit and
wit in him, was cruelly repre&#383;&#383;ed as
forwardne&#383;s in me.</p>

<p>"My mother had an indolence of
character, which prevented her from
paying much attention to our education.
But the healthy breeze of a
neighbouring heath, on which we
bounded at plea&#383;ure, volatilized the
humours that improper food might
have generated. And to enjoy open
air and freedom, was paradi&#383;e, after
the unnatural re&#383;traint of our fire-&#383;ide,
where we were often obliged to &#383;it
three or four hours together, without
daring to utter a word, when my fa<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-146_S" id="APg_1-146_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-146.png">146</a>]</span>ther
was out of humour, from want of
employment, or of a variety of boi&#383;terous
amu&#383;ement. I had however one
advantage, an in&#383;tructor, the brother
of my father, who, intended for the
church, had of cour&#383;e received a
liberal education. But, becoming attached
to a young lady of great beauty
and large fortune, and acquiring in the
world &#383;ome opinions not con&#383;onant
with the profe&#383;&#383;ion for which he was
de&#383;igned, he accepted, with the mo&#383;t
&#383;anguine expectations of &#383;ucce&#383;s, the
offer of a nobleman to accompany him
to India, as his confidential &#383;ecretary.</p>

<p>"A corre&#383;pondence was regularly
kept up with the object of his affection;
and the intricacies of bu&#383;ine&#383;s, peculiarly
weari&#383;ome to a man of a romantic
turn of mind, contributed, with a forced
ab&#383;ence, to increa&#383;e his attachment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-147_S" id="APg_1-147_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-147.png">147</a>]</span>
Every other pa&#383;&#383;ion was lo&#383;t in this
ma&#383;ter-one, and only &#383;erved to &#383;well the
torrent. Her relations, &#383;uch were his
waking dreams, who had de&#383;pi&#383;ed him,
would court in their turn his alliance,
and all the blandi&#383;hments of ta&#383;te would
grace the triumph of love.&mdash;While he
ba&#383;ked in the warm &#383;un&#383;hine of love,
friend&#383;hip al&#383;o promi&#383;ed to &#383;hed its
dewy fre&#383;hne&#383;s; for a friend, whom he
loved next to his mi&#383;tre&#383;s, was the confident,
who forwarded the letters from
one to the other, to elude the ob&#383;ervation
of prying relations. A friend fal&#383;e
in &#383;imilar circum&#383;tances, is, my deare&#383;t
girl, an old tale; yet, let not this example,
or the frigid caution of cold-blooded
morali&#383;ts, make you endeavour
to &#383;tifle hopes, which are the buds that
naturally unfold them&#383;elves during the
&#383;pring of life! Whil&#383;t your own heart<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-148_S" id="APg_1-148_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-148.png">148</a>]</span>
is &#383;incere, always expect to meet one
glowing with the &#383;ame &#383;entiments; for
to fly from plea&#383;ure, is not to avoid
pain!</p>

<p>"My uncle realized, by good luck,
rather than management, a hand&#383;ome
fortune; and returning on the wings of
love, lo&#383;t in the mo&#383;t enchanting reveries,
to England, to &#383;hare it with his
mi&#383;tre&#383;s and his friend, he found them&mdash;united.</p>

<p>"There were &#383;ome circum&#383;tances, not
nece&#383;&#383;ary for me to recite, which aggravated
the guilt of the friend beyond mea&#383;ure,
and the deception, that had been carried
on to the la&#383;t moment, was &#383;o ba&#383;e,
it produced the mo&#383;t violent effect on
my uncle's health and &#383;pirits. His native
country, the world! lately a garden of
blooming &#383;weets, bla&#383;ted by treachery,
&#383;eemed changed into a parched de&#383;ert,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-149_S" id="APg_1-149_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-149.png">149</a>]</span>
the abode of hi&#383;&#383;ing &#383;erpents. Di&#383;appointment
rankled in his heart; and,
brooding over his wrongs, he was attacked
by a raging fever, followed by
a derangement of mind, which only
gave place to habitual melancholy, as
he recovered more &#383;trength of body.</p>

<p>"Declaring an intention never to
marry, his relations were ever clu&#383;tering
about him, paying the gro&#383;&#383;e&#383;t adulation
to a man, who, di&#383;gu&#383;ted with
mankind, received them with &#383;corn, or
bitter &#383;arca&#383;ms. Something in my
countenance plea&#383;ed him, when I began
to prattle. Since his return, he appeared
dead to affection; but I &#383;oon,
by &#383;howing him innocent fondne&#383;s, became
a favourite; and endeavouring
to enlarge and &#383;trengthen my mind, I
grew dear to him in proportion as I imbibed
his &#383;entiments. He had a forcible<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-150_S" id="APg_1-150_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-150.png">150</a>]</span>
manner of &#383;peaking, rendered more
&#383;o by a certain impre&#383;&#383;ive wildne&#383;s of
look and ge&#383;ture, calculated to engage
the attention of a young and ardent
mind. It is not then &#383;urpri&#383;ing that I
quickly adopted his opinions in preference,
and reverenced him as one of
a &#383;uperior order of beings. He inculcated,
with great warmth, &#383;elf-re&#383;pect,
and a lofty con&#383;ciou&#383;ne&#383;s of acting
right, independent of the cen&#383;ure or
applau&#383;e of the world; nay, he almo&#383;t
taught me to brave, and even de&#383;pi&#383;e
its cen&#383;ure, when convinced of the rectitude
of my own intentions.</p>

<p>"Endeavouring to prove to me that
nothing which de&#383;erved the name of
love or friend&#383;hip, exi&#383;ted in the world,
he drew &#383;uch animated pictures of his
own feelings, rendered permanent by
di&#383;appointment, as imprinted the &#383;en<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-151_S" id="APg_1-151_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-151.png">151</a>]</span>timents
&#383;trongly on my heart, and animated
my imagination. The&#383;e remarks
are nece&#383;&#383;ary to elucidate &#383;ome peculiarities
in my character, which by the
world are indefinitely termed romantic.</p>

<p>"My uncle's increa&#383;ing affection led
him to vi&#383;it me often. Still, unable to
re&#383;t in any place, he did not remain
long in the country to &#383;often dome&#383;tic
tyranny; but he brought me books, for
which I had a pa&#383;&#383;ion, and they con&#383;pired
with his conver&#383;ation, to make
me form an ideal picture of life. I &#383;hall
pa&#383;s over the tyranny of my father,
much as I &#383;uffered from it; but it is
nece&#383;&#383;ary to notice, that it undermined
my mother's health; and that
her temper, continually irritated by
dome&#383;tic bickering, became intolerably
peevi&#383;h.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-152_S" id="APg_1-152_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-152.png">152</a>]</span>
"My elde&#383;t brother was articled to a
neighbouring attorney, the &#383;hrewde&#383;t,
and, I may add, the mo&#383;t unprincipled
man in that part of the country. As
my brother generally came home every
Saturday, to a&#383;toni&#383;h my mother by
exhibiting his attainments, he gradually
a&#383;&#383;umed a right of directing the
whole family, not excepting my father.
He &#383;eemed to take a peculiar plea&#383;ure
in tormenting and humbling me; and
if I ever ventured to complain of this
treatment to either my father or mother,
I was rudely rebuffed for pre&#383;uming
to judge of the conduct of my elde&#383;t
brother.</p>

<p>"About this period a merchant's
family came to &#383;ettle in our neighbourhood.
A man&#383;ion-hou&#383;e in the village,
lately purcha&#383;ed, had been preparing
the whole &#383;pring, and the &#383;ight of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-153_S" id="APg_1-153_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-153.png">153</a>]</span>
co&#383;tly furniture, &#383;ent from London, had
excited my mother's envy, and rou&#383;ed
my father's pride. My &#383;en&#383;ations were
very different, and all of a plea&#383;urable
kind. I longed to &#383;ee new characters,
to break the tedious monotony of my
life; and to find a friend, &#383;uch as fancy
had pourtrayed. I cannot then de&#383;cribe
the emotion I felt, the Sunday they
made their appearance at church. My
eyes were rivetted on the pillar round
which I expected fir&#383;t to catch a glimp&#383;e
of them, and darted forth to meet a
&#383;ervant who ha&#383;tily preceded a group
of ladies, who&#383;e white robes and waving
plumes, &#383;eemed to &#383;tream along the
gloomy ai&#383;le, diffu&#383;ing the light, by
which I contemplated their figures.</p>

<p>"We vi&#383;ited them in form; and I
quickly &#383;elected the elde&#383;t daughter for
my friend. The &#383;econd &#383;on, George,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-154_S" id="APg_1-154_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-154.png">154</a>]</span>
paid me particular attention, and finding
his attainments and manners &#383;uperior
to tho&#383;e of the young men of the
village, I began to imagine him &#383;uperior
to the re&#383;t of mankind. Had my home
been more comfortable, or my previous
acquaintance more numerous, I &#383;hould
not probably have been &#383;o eager to
open my heart to new affections.</p>

<p>"Mr. Venables, the merchant, had
acquired a large fortune by unremitting
attention to bu&#383;ine&#383;s; but his health declining
rapidly, he was obliged to retire,
before his &#383;on, George, had acquired
&#383;ufficient experience, to enable
him to conduct their affairs on the &#383;ame
prudential plan, his father had invariably
pur&#383;ued. Indeed, he had laboured
to throw off his authority,
having de&#383;pi&#383;ed his narrow plans and
cautious &#383;peculation. The elde&#383;t &#383;on<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-155_S" id="APg_1-155_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-155.png">155</a>]</span>
could not be prevailed on to enter the
firm; and, to oblige his wife, and have
peace in the hou&#383;e, Mr. Venables had
purcha&#383;ed a commi&#383;&#383;ion for him in the
guards.</p>

<p>"I am now alluding to circum&#383;tances
which came to my knowledge long
after; but it is nece&#383;&#383;ary, my deare&#383;t
child, that you &#383;hould know the character
of your father, to prevent your
de&#383;pi&#383;ing your mother; the only parent
inclined to di&#383;charge a parent's duty.
In London, George had acquired habits
of libertini&#383;m, which he carefully concealed
from his father and his commercial
connections. The ma&#383;k he
wore, was &#383;o complete a covering of
his real vi&#383;age, that the prai&#383;e his father
lavi&#383;hed on his conduct, and, poor
mi&#383;taken man! on his principles, contra&#383;ted
with his brother's, rendered the<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-156_S" id="APg_1-156_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-156.png">156</a>]</span>
notice he took of me peculiarly flattering.
Without any fixed de&#383;ign, as I
am now convinced, he continued to
&#383;ingle me out at the dance, pre&#383;s my
hand at parting, and utter expre&#383;&#383;ions
of unmeaning pa&#383;&#383;ion, to which I gave
a meaning naturally &#383;ugge&#383;ted by the
romantic turn of my thoughts. His
&#383;tay in the country was &#383;hort; his manners
did not entirely plea&#383;e me; but,
when he left us, the colouring of my
picture became more vivid&mdash;Whither
did not my imagination lead me? In
&#383;hort, I fancied my&#383;elf in love&mdash;in love
with the di&#383;intere&#383;tedne&#383;s, fortitude,
genero&#383;ity, dignity, and humanity, with
which I had inve&#383;ted the hero I dubbed.
A circum&#383;tance which &#383;oon after
occurred, rendered all the&#383;e virtues
palpable. [The incident is perhaps
worth relating on other accounts, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-157_S" id="APg_1-157_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-157.png">157</a>]</span>
therefore I &#383;hall de&#383;cribe it di&#383;tinctly.]</p>

<p>"I had a great affection for my nur&#383;e,
old Mary, for whom I u&#383;ed often to
work, to &#383;pare her eyes. Mary had a
younger &#383;i&#383;ter, married to a &#383;ailor, while
&#383;he was &#383;uckling me; for my mother
only &#383;uckled my elde&#383;t brother, which
might be the cau&#383;e of her extraordinary
partiality. Peggy, Mary's &#383;i&#383;ter, lived
with her, till her hu&#383;band, becoming a
mate in a We&#383;t-India trader, got a little
before-hand in the world. He
wrote to his wife from the fir&#383;t port in
the Channel, after his mo&#383;t &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful
voyage, to reque&#383;t her to come to
London to meet him; he even wi&#383;hed
her to determine on living there for the
future, to &#383;ave him the trouble of coming
to her the moment he came on
&#383;hore; and to turn a penny by keeping<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-158_S" id="APg_1-158_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-158.png">158</a>]</span>
a green-&#383;tall. It was too much to &#383;et out
on a journey the moment he had fini&#383;hed
a voyage, and fifty miles by land, was
wor&#383;e than a thou&#383;and leagues by &#383;ea.</p>

<p>"She packed up her alls, and came to
London&mdash;but did not meet hone&#383;t Daniel.
A common mi&#383;fortune prevented
her, and the poor are bound to &#383;uffer
for the good of their country&mdash;he was
pre&#383;&#383;ed in the river&mdash;and never came on
&#383;hore.</p>

<p>"Peggy was mi&#383;erable in London,
not knowing, as &#383;he &#383;aid, 'the face of
any living &#383;oul.' Be&#383;ides, her imagination
had been employed, anticipating
a month or &#383;ix weeks' happine&#383;s with
her hu&#383;band. Daniel was to have gone
with her to Sadler's Wells, and We&#383;tmin&#383;ter
Abbey, and to many &#383;ights,
which he knew &#383;he never heard of in
the country. Peggy too was thrifty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-159_S" id="APg_1-159_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-159.png">159</a>]</span>
and how could &#383;he manage to put his
plan in execution alone? He had acquaintance;
but &#383;he did not know the
very name of their places of abode.
His letters were made up of&mdash;How do
you does, and God ble&#383;s yous,&mdash;information
was re&#383;erved for the hour of
meeting.</p>

<p>"She too had her portion of information,
near at heart. Molly and Jacky
were grown &#383;uch little darlings, &#383;he
was almo&#383;t angry that daddy did not
&#383;ee their tricks. She had not half the
plea&#383;ure &#383;he &#383;hould have had from their
prattle, could &#383;he have recounted to
him each night the pretty &#383;peeches of
the day. Some &#383;tories, however, were
&#383;tored up&mdash;and Jacky could &#383;ay papa
with &#383;uch a &#383;weet voice, it mu&#383;t delight
his heart. Yet when &#383;he came, and
found no Daniel to greet her, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-160_S" id="APg_1-160_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-160.png">160</a>]</span>
Jacky called papa, &#383;he wept, bidding
'God ble&#383;s his innocent &#383;oul, that
did not know what &#383;orrow was.'&mdash;But
more &#383;orrow was in &#383;tore for Peggy,
innocent as &#383;he was.&mdash;Daniel was killed
in the fir&#383;t engagement, and then
the <i>papa</i> was agony, &#383;ounding to the
heart.</p>

<p>"She had lived &#383;paringly on his wages,
while there was any hope of his return;
but, that gone, &#383;he returned with a
breaking heart to the country, to a
little market town, nearly three miles
from our village. She did not like to
go to &#383;ervice, to be &#383;nubbed about,
after being her own mi&#383;tre&#383;s. To put
her children out to nur&#383;e was impo&#383;&#383;ible:
how far would her wages go? and
to &#383;end them to her hu&#383;band's pari&#383;h, a
di&#383;tant one, was to lo&#383;e her hu&#383;band
twice over.</p>

weeping for Daniel, when Jacky's arch

<p>"The country people were hone&#383;t,
and Peggy left her linen out to dry
very late. A recruiting party, as &#383;he
&#383;uppo&#383;ed, pa&#383;&#383;ing through, made free
with a large wa&#383;h; for it was all &#383;wept
away, including her own and her children's
little &#383;tock.</p>

<p>"This was a dreadful blow; two dozen
of &#383;hirts, &#383;tocks and handkerchiefs.
She gave the money which &#383;he
had laid by for half a year's rent, and
promi&#383;ed to pay two &#383;hillings a week
till all was cleared; &#383;o &#383;he did not lo&#383;e
her employment. This two &#383;hillings a
week, and the buying a few nece&#383;&#383;aries
for the children, drove her &#383;o hard,
that &#383;he had not a penny to pay her rent
with, when a twelvemonth's became
due.</p>

"She was now with Mary, and had
ju&#383;t told her tale, which Mary in&#383;tantly
repeated&mdash;it was intended for my
ear. Many hou&#383;es in this town, producing
a borough-intere&#383;t, were included
in the e&#383;tate purcha&#383;ed by Mr.
Venables, and the attorney with whom
my brother lived, was appointed his
agent, to collect and rai&#383;e the rents.</p>

<p>"He demanded Peggy's, and, in
&#383;pite of her intreaties, her poor goods
had been &#383;eized and &#383;old. So that &#383;he
had not, and what was wor&#383;e her children,

that I was good-natured&mdash;right charitable,
yet not liking to a&#383;k for more

while people could any how be

&#383;tarve&mdash;and what would become of her
children?&mdash;'had Daniel not been
pre&#383;&#383;ed&mdash;but God knows be&#383;t&mdash;all this
could not have happened.'</p>

<p>"I had two mattra&#383;&#383;es on my bed;
what did I want with two, when
&#383;uch a worthy creature mu&#383;t lie on the
ground? My mother would be angry,
but I could conceal it till my uncle
came down; and then I would tell him
all the whole truth, and if he ab&#383;olved
me, heaven would.</p>

<p>"I begged the hou&#383;e-maid to come
up &#383;tairs with me (&#383;ervants always feel
for the di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;es of poverty, and &#383;o
would the rich if they knew what it
was). She a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ted me to tie up the
mattra&#383;s; I di&#383;covering, at the &#383;ame
time, that one blanket would &#383;erve me<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-165_S" id="APg_1-165_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-165.png">165</a>]</span>
till winter, could I per&#383;uade my &#383;i&#383;ter,
who &#383;lept with me, to keep my &#383;ecret.
She entering in the mid&#383;t of the package,
I gave her &#383;ome new feathers, to
&#383;ilence her. We got the mattra&#383;s
down the back &#383;tairs, unperceived,
and I helped to carry it, taking with
me all the money I had, and what I
could borrow from my &#383;i&#383;ter.</p>

<p>"When I got to the cottage, Peggy
declared that &#383;he would not take what
I had brought &#383;ecretly; but, when,
with all the eager eloquence in&#383;pired
by a decided purpo&#383;e, I gra&#383;ped her
hand with weeping eyes, a&#383;&#383;uring her
that my uncle would &#383;creen me from
blame, when he was once more in the
country, de&#383;cribing, at the &#383;ame time,
what &#383;he would &#383;uffer in parting with
her children, after keeping them &#383;o
long from being thrown on the pari&#383;h,
&#383;he reluctantly con&#383;ented.</p>

"My project of u&#383;efulne&#383;s ended not
here; I determined to &#383;peak to the
attorney; he frequently paid me compliments.
His character did not intimidate
me; but, imagining that Peggy
mu&#383;t be mi&#383;taken, and that no man
could turn a deaf ear to &#383;uch a tale of
complicated di&#383;tre&#383;s, I determined to
walk to the town with Mary the next
morning, and reque&#383;t him to wait for
the rent, and keep my &#383;ecret, till my
uncle's return.</p>

<p>"My repo&#383;e was &#383;weet; and, waking
with the fir&#383;t dawn of day, I bounded
to Mary's cottage. What charms do
not a light heart &#383;pread over nature!
Every bird that twittered in a bu&#383;h,
every flower that enlivened the hedge,
&#383;eemed placed there to awaken me to
rapture&mdash;yes; to rapture. The pre&#383;ent
moment was full fraught with happi<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-167_S" id="APg_1-167_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-167.png">167</a>]</span>ne&#383;s;
and on futurity I be&#383;towed not a
thought, excepting to anticipate my
&#383;ucce&#383;s with the attorney.</p>

<p>"This man of the world, with ro&#383;y
face and &#383;impering features, received
me politely, nay kindly; li&#383;tened with
complacency to my remon&#383;trances,
though he &#383;carcely heeded Mary's tears.
I did not then &#383;u&#383;pect, that my eloquence
was in my complexion, the
blu&#383;h of &#383;eventeen, or that, in a world
where humanity to women is the characteri&#383;tic
of advancing civilization, the
beauty of a young girl was &#383;o much
more intere&#383;ting than the di&#383;tre&#383;s of an
old one. Pre&#383;&#383;ing my hand, he promi&#383;ed
to let Peggy remain in the hou&#383;e
as long as I wi&#383;hed.&mdash;I more than returned
the pre&#383;&#383;ure&mdash;I was &#383;o grateful
and &#383;o happy. Emboldened by my innocent
warmth, he then ki&#383;&#383;ed me<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-168_S" id="APg_1-168_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-168.png">168</a>]</span>&mdash;and
I did not draw back&mdash;I took it for
a ki&#383;s of charity.</p>

<p>"Gay as a lark, I went to dine at Mr.
Venables'. I had previou&#383;ly obtained
five &#383;hillings from my father, towards
re-clothing the poor children of my
care, and prevailed on my mother to
take one of the girls into the hou&#383;e, whom
I determined to teach to work and read.</p>

<p>"After dinner, when the younger part
of the circle retired to the mu&#383;ic room,
I recounted with energy my tale; that
is, I mentioned Peggy's di&#383;tre&#383;s, without
hinting at the &#383;teps I had taken to
relieve her. Mi&#383;s Venables gave me
half-a-crown; the heir five &#383;hillings;
but George &#383;at unmoved. I was cruelly
di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;ed by the di&#383;appointment&mdash;I
&#383;carcely could remain on my chair;
and, could I have got out of the room
unperceived, I &#383;hould have flown home,
as if to run away from my&#383;elf. After<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-169_S" id="APg_1-169_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-169.png">169</a>]</span>
&#383;everal vain attempts to ri&#383;e, I leaned
my head again&#383;t the marble chimney-piece,
and gazing on the evergreens
that filled the fire-place, moralized on
the vanity of human expectations; regardle&#383;s
of the company. I was rou&#383;ed
by a gentle tap on my &#383;houlder from
behind Charlotte's chair. I turned
my head, and George &#383;lid a guinea into
my hand, putting his finger to his
mouth, to enjoin me &#383;ilence.</p>

<p>"What a revolution took place, not
only in my train of thoughts, but feelings!
I trembled with emotion&mdash;now,
indeed, I was in love. Such delicacy
too, to enhance his benevolence! I felt
in my pocket every five minutes, only
to feel the guinea; and its magic touch
inve&#383;ted my hero with more than mortal
beauty. My fancy had found a ba&#383;is
to erect its model of perfection on;<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-170_S" id="APg_1-170_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-170.png">170</a>]</span>
and quickly went to work, with all the
happy credulity of youth, to con&#383;ider
that heart as devoted to virtue, which
had only obeyed a virtuous impul&#383;e.
The bitter experience was yet to come,
that has taught me how very di&#383;tinct
are the principles of virtue, from the
ca&#383;ual feelings from which they germinate.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">I have</span> perhaps dwelt too long on
a circum&#383;tance, which is only of importance
as it marks the progre&#383;s of a
deception that has been &#383;o fatal to my
peace; and introduces to your notice a
poor girl, whom, intending to &#383;erve, I led
to ruin. Still it is probable that I was
not entirely the victim of mi&#383;take; and
that your father, gradually fa&#383;hioned
by the world, did not quickly become
what I he&#383;itate to call him&mdash;out of
re&#383;pect to my daughter.</p>

<p>"But, to ha&#383;ten to the more bu&#383;y
&#383;cenes of my life. Mr. Venables and
my mother died the &#383;ame &#383;ummer;
and, wholly engro&#383;&#383;ed by my attention
to her, I thought of little el&#383;e.
The neglect of her darling, my brother
Robert, had a violent effect on<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-172_S" id="APg_1-172_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-172.png">172</a>]</span>
her weakened mind; for, though boys
may be reckoned the pillars of the
hou&#383;e without doors, girls are often the
only comfort within. They but too frequently
wa&#383;te their health and &#383;pirits
attending a dying parent, who leaves
them in comparative poverty. After
clo&#383;ing, with filial piety, a father's
eyes, they are cha&#383;ed from the paternal
roof, to make room for the fir&#383;t-born,
the &#383;on, who is to carry the
empty family-name down to po&#383;terity;
though, occupied with his own plea&#383;ures,
he &#383;carcely thought of di&#383;charging,
in the decline of his parent's life,
the debt contracted in his childhood.
My mother's conduct led me to make
the&#383;e reflections. Great as was the fatigue
I endured, and the affection my
uncea&#383;ing &#383;olicitude evinced, of which
my mother &#383;eemed perfectly &#383;en&#383;ible,
&#383;till, when my brother, whom I could<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-173_S" id="APg_1-173_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-173.png">173</a>]</span>
hardly per&#383;uade to remain a quarter of
an hour in her chamber, was with her
alone, a &#383;hort time before her death,
&#383;he gave him a little hoard, which &#383;he
had been &#383;ome years accumulating.</p>

<p>"During my mother's illne&#383;s, I was
obliged to manage my father's temper,
who, from the lingering nature of her
malady, began to imagine that it was
merely fancy. At this period, an artful
kind of upper &#383;ervant attracted my
father's attention, and the neighbours
made many remarks on the finery, not
hone&#383;tly got, exhibited at evening &#383;ervice.
But I was too much occupied
with my mother to ob&#383;erve any change
in her dre&#383;s or behaviour, or to li&#383;ten to
the whi&#383;per of &#383;candal.</p>

<p>"I &#383;hall not dwell on the death-bed
&#383;cene, lively as is the remembrance,
or on the emotion produced by the la&#383;t<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-174_S" id="APg_1-174_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-174.png">174</a>]</span>
gra&#383;p of my mother's cold hand; when
ble&#383;&#383;ing me, &#383;he added, 'A little patience,
and all will be over!' Ah!
my child, how often have tho&#383;e words
rung mournfully in my ears&mdash;and I
have exclaimed&mdash;'A little more patience,
and I too &#383;hall be at re&#383;t!'</p>

<p>"My father was violently affected
by her death, recollected in&#383;tances of
his unkindne&#383;s, and wept like a child.</p>

<p>"My mother had &#383;olemnly recommended
my &#383;i&#383;ters to my care, and bid
me be a mother to them. They, indeed,
became more dear to me as they
became more forlorn; for, during my
mother's illne&#383;s, I di&#383;covered the ruined
&#383;tate of my father's circum&#383;tances,
and that he had only been able to keep
up appearances, by the &#383;ums which he
borrowed of my uncle.</p>

<p>"My father's grief, and con&#383;equent<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-175_S" id="APg_1-175_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-175.png">175</a>]</span>
tenderne&#383;s to his children, quickly
abated, the hou&#383;e grew &#383;till more
gloomy or riotous; and my refuge
from care was again at Mr. Venables';
the young '&#383;quire having taken his father's
place, and allowing, for the pre&#383;ent,
his &#383;i&#383;ter to pre&#383;ide at his table.
George, though di&#383;&#383;ati&#383;fied with his
portion of the fortune, which had till
lately been all in trade, vi&#383;ited the family
as u&#383;ual. He was now full of &#383;peculations
in trade, and his brow became
clouded by care. He &#383;eemed to relax
in his attention to me, when the pre&#383;ence
of my uncle gave a new turn to
his behaviour. I was too un&#383;u&#383;pecting,
too di&#383;intere&#383;ted, to trace the&#383;e changes
to their &#383;ource.</p>

<p>My home every day became more
and more di&#383;agreeable to me; my liberty
was unnece&#383;&#383;arily abridged, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-176_S" id="APg_1-176_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-176.png">176</a>]</span>
my books, on the pretext that they made
me idle, taken from me. My father's
mi&#383;tre&#383;s was with child, and he, doating
on her, allowed or overlooked her
vulgar manner of tyrannizing over us.
I was indignant, e&#383;pecially when I &#383;aw
her endeavouring to attract, &#383;hall I
&#383;ay &#383;educe? my younger brother. By
allowing women but one way of ri&#383;ing
in the world, the fo&#383;tering the libertini&#383;m
of men, &#383;ociety makes mon&#383;ters
of them, and then their ignoble
vices are brought forward as a proof of
inferiority of intellect.</p>

<p>The weari&#383;omene&#383;s of my &#383;ituation
can &#383;carcely be de&#383;cribed. Though my
life had not pa&#383;&#383;ed in the mo&#383;t even tenour
with my mother, it was paradi&#383;e
to that I was de&#383;tined to endure with
my father's mi&#383;tre&#383;s, jealous of her illegitimate
authority. My father's former<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-177_S" id="APg_1-177_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-177.png">177</a>]</span>
occa&#383;ional tenderne&#383;s, in &#383;pite of his
violence of temper, had been &#383;oothing
to me; but now he only met me with
reproofs or portentous frowns. The
hou&#383;e-keeper, as &#383;he was now termed,
was the vulgar de&#383;pot of the family;
and a&#383;&#383;uming the new character of a
fine lady, &#383;he could never forgive the
contempt which was &#383;ometimes vi&#383;ible
in my countenance, when &#383;he uttered
with pompo&#383;ity her bad Engli&#383;h, or
affected to be well bred.</p>

<p>To my uncle I ventured to open my
heart; and he, with his wonted benevolence,
began to con&#383;ider in what
manner he could extricate me out of
my pre&#383;ent irk&#383;ome &#383;ituation. In &#383;pite
of his own di&#383;appointment, or, mo&#383;t
probably, actuated by the feelings that
had been petrified, not cooled, in all
their &#383;anguine fervour, like a boiling
torrent of lava &#383;uddenly da&#383;hing into<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-178_S" id="APg_1-178_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-178.png">178</a>]</span>
the &#383;ea, he thought a marriage of mutual
inclination (would envious &#383;tars
permit it) the only chance for happine&#383;s
in this di&#383;a&#383;trous world. George
Venables had the reputation of being
attentive to bu&#383;ine&#383;s, and my father's
example gave great weight to this circum&#383;tance;
for habits of order in bu&#383;ine&#383;s
would, he conceived, extend to
the regulation of the affections in dome&#383;tic
life. George &#383;eldom &#383;poke in
my uncle's company, except to utter a
&#383;hort, judicious que&#383;tion, or to make a
pertinent remark, with all due deference
to his &#383;uperior judgment; &#383;o that
my uncle &#383;eldom left his company without
ob&#383;erving, that the young man had
more in him than people &#383;uppo&#383;ed.</p>

<p>In this opinion he was not &#383;ingular;
yet, believe me, and I am not &#383;wayed
by re&#383;entment, the&#383;e &#383;peeches &#383;o ju&#383;tly<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-179_S" id="APg_1-179_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-179.png">179</a>]</span>
poized, this &#383;ilent deference, when the
animal &#383;pirits of other young people
were throwing off youthful ebullitions,
were not the effect of thought or humility,
but &#383;heer barrenne&#383;s of mind,
and want of imagination. A colt of
mettle will curvet and &#383;hew his paces.
Yes; my dear girl, the&#383;e prudent
young men want all the fire nece&#383;&#383;ary
to ferment their faculties, and are characterized
as wi&#383;e, only becau&#383;e they
are not fooli&#383;h. It is true, that George
was by no means &#383;o great a favourite
of mine as during the fir&#383;t year of our
acquaintance; &#383;till, as he often coincided
in opinion with me, and echoed
my &#383;entiments; and having my&#383;elf no
other attachment, I heard with plea&#383;ure
my uncle's propo&#383;al; but thought
more of obtaining my freedom, than
of my lover. But, when George, &#383;eem<span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-180_S" id="APg_1-180_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-180.png">180</a>]</span>ingly
anxious for my happine&#383;s, pre&#383;&#383;ed
me to quit my pre&#383;ent painful &#383;ituation,
my heart &#383;welled with gratitude&mdash;I
knew not that my uncle had promi&#383;ed
him five thou&#383;and pounds.</p>

<p>Had this truly generous man mentioned
his intention to me, I &#383;hould have in&#383;i&#383;ted
on a thou&#383;and pounds being &#383;ettled
on each of my &#383;i&#383;ters; George would
have conte&#383;ted; I &#383;hould have &#383;een his
&#383;elfi&#383;h &#383;oul; and&mdash;gracious God! have
been &#383;pared the mi&#383;ery of di&#383;covering,
when too late, that I was united to a
heartle&#383;s, unprincipled wretch. All
my &#383;chemes of u&#383;efulne&#383;s would not
then have been bla&#383;ted. The tenderne&#383;s
of my heart would not have heated
my imagination with vi&#383;ions of the
ineffable delight of happy love; nor
would the &#383;weet duty of a mother have
been &#383;o cruelly interrupted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="APg_1-181_S" id="APg_1-181_S"></a>[<a href="images/v1-181.png">181</a>]</span>
But I mu&#383;t not &#383;uffer the fortitude
I have &#383;o hardly acquired, to be undermined
by unavailing regret. Let me
ha&#383;ten forward to de&#383;cribe the turbid
&#383;tream in which I had to wade&mdash;but
let me exultingly declare that it is
pa&#383;&#383;ed&mdash;my &#383;oul holds fellow&#383;hip with
him no more. He cut the Gordian
knot, which my principles, mi&#383;taken
ones, re&#383;pected; he di&#383;&#383;olved the tie, the
fetters rather, that ate into my very
vitals&mdash;and I &#383;hould rejoice, con&#383;cious
that my mind is freed, though confined
in hell it&#383;elf; the only place that even
fancy can imagine more dreadful than
my pre&#383;ent abode.</p>

<p>The&#383;e varying emotions will not allow
me to proceed. I heave &#383;igh after
&#383;igh; yet my heart is &#383;till oppre&#383;&#383;ed.
For what am I re&#383;erved? Why was I not
born a man, or why was I born at all?</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">I Resume</span> my pen to fly from thought.
I was married; and we hastened to
London. I had purposed taking one of
my sisters with me; for a strong motive
for marrying, was the desire of having
a home at which I could receive them,
now their own grew so uncomfortable,
as not to deserve the cheering appellation.
An objection was made to her<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-2" id="BPg_2-2"></a>[<a href="images/v2-2.png">2</a>]</span>
accompanying me, that appeared plausible;
and I reluctantly acquiesced. I
was however willingly allowed to take
with me Molly, poor Peggy's daughter.
London and preferment, are ideas commonly
associated in the country; and,
as blooming as May, she bade adieu to
Peggy with weeping eyes. I did not
even feel hurt at the refusal in relation
to my sister, till hearing what my uncle
had done for me, I had the simplicity
to request, speaking with warmth of
their situation, that he would give them
a thousand pounds a-piece, which
seemed to me but justice. He asked
me, giving me a kiss, 'If I had lost my
senses?' I started back, as if I had
found a wasp in a rose-bush. I expostulated.
He sneered; and the demon
of discord entered our paradise, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-3" id="BPg_2-3"></a>[<a href="images/v2-3.png">3</a>]</span>
poison with his pestiferous breath every
opening joy.</p>

<p>"I had sometimes observed defects
in my husband's understanding; but, led
astray by a prevailing opinion, that
goodness of disposition is of the first importance
in the relative situations of
life, in proportion as I perceived the
narrowness of his understanding, fancy
enlarged the boundary of his heart.
Fatal error! How quickly is the so
much vaunted milkiness of nature turned
into gall, by an intercourse with the
world, if more generous juices do not
sustain the vital source of virtue!</p>

<p>"One trait in my character was extreme
credulity; but, when my eyes were
once opened, I saw but too clearly all
I had before overlooked. My husband
was sunk in my esteem; still there are
youthful emotions, which, for a while,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-4" id="BPg_2-4"></a>[<a href="images/v2-4.png">4</a>]</span>
fill up the chasm of love and friendship.
Besides, it required some time to enable
me to see his whole character in a
just light, or rather to allow it to become
fixed. While circumstances were
ripening my faculties, and cultivating
my taste, commerce and gross relaxations
were shutting his against any
possibility of improvement, till, by
stifling every spark of virtue in himself,
he began to imagine that it no where
existed.</p>

<p>"Do not let me lead you astray, my
child, I do not mean to assert, that
any human being is entirely incapable
of feeling the generous emotions, which
are the foundation of every true principle
of virtue; but they are frequently,
I fear, so feeble, that, like the inflammable
quality which more or less
lurks in all bodies, they often lie for<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-5" id="BPg_2-5"></a>[<a href="images/v2-5.png">5</a>]</span>
ever dormant; the circumstances never
occurring, necessary to call them into
action.</p>

<p>"I discovered however by chance,
that, in consequence of some losses in
trade, the natural effect of his gambling
desire to start suddenly into riches,
the five thousand pounds given me by
my uncle, had been paid very opportunely.
This discovery, strange as you
may think the assertion, gave me pleasure;
my husband's embarrassments
endeared him to me. I was glad to
find an excuse for his conduct to my
sisters, and my mind became calmer.</p>

<p>"My uncle introduced me to some
literary society; and the theatres were
a never-failing source of amusement to
me. My delighted eye followed Mrs.
Siddons, when, with dignified delicacy,
she played Calista; and I involuntarily<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-6" id="BPg_2-6"></a>[<a href="images/v2-6.png">6</a>]</span>
repeated after her, in the same tone,
and with a long-drawn sigh,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Hearts like our's were pair'd&mdash;not match'd.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"These were, at first, spontaneous
emotions, though, becoming acquainted
with men of wit and polished manners,
I could not sometimes help regretting
my early marriage; and that,
in my haste to escape from a temporary
dependence, and expand my newly
fledged wings, in an unknown sky, I
had been caught in a trap, and caged
for life. Still the novelty of London,
and the attentive fondness of my husband,
for he had some personal regard
for me, made several months glide
away. Yet, not forgetting the situation
of my sisters, who were still very
young, I prevailed on my uncle to set<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-7" id="BPg_2-7"></a>[<a href="images/v2-7.png">7</a>]</span>tle
a thousand pounds on each; and
to place them in a school near town,
where I could frequently visit, as well
as have them at home with me.</p>

<p>"I now tried to improve my husband's
taste, but we had few subjects in
common; indeed he soon appeared
to have little relish for my society, unless
he was hinting to me the use he
could make of my uncle's wealth.
When we had company, I was disgusted
by an ostentatious display of
riches, and I have often quitted the
room, to avoid listening to exaggerated
tales of money obtained by lucky hits.</p>

<p>"With all my attention and affectionate
interest, I perceived that I
could not become the friend or confident
of my husband. Every thing I
learned relative to his affairs I gathered
up by accident; and I vainly endea<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-8" id="BPg_2-8"></a>[<a href="images/v2-8.png">8</a>]</span>voured
to establish, at our fire-side,
that social converse, which often renders
people of different characters dear to
each other. Returning from the theatre,
or any amusing party, I frequently
began to relate what I had seen and
highly relished; but with sullen taciturnity
he soon silenced me. I seemed
therefore gradually to lose, in his society,
the soul, the energies of which
had just been in action. To such a degree,
in fact, did his cold, reserved
manner affect me, that, after spending
some days with him alone, I have
imagined myself the most stupid creature
in the world, till the abilities of
some casual visitor convinced me that I
had some dormant animation, and sentiments
above the dust in which I had
been groveling. The very countenance
of my husband changed; his com<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-9" id="BPg_2-9"></a>[<a href="images/v2-9.png">9</a>]</span>plexion
became sallow, and all the
charms of youth were vanishing with
its vivacity.</p>

<p>"I give you one view of the subject;
but these experiments and alterations
took up the space of five years; during
which period, I had most reluctantly extorted
several sums from my uncle, to
save my husband, to use his own words,
from destruction. At first it was to prevent
bills being noted, to the injury of
his credit; then to bail him; and afterwards
to prevent an execution from
entering the house. I began at last to
conclude, that he would have made
more exertions of his own to extricate
himself, had he not relied on mine,
cruel as was the task he imposed on me;
and I firmly determined that I would
make use of no more pretexts.</p>

<p>"From the moment I pronounced<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-10" id="BPg_2-10"></a>[<a href="images/v2-10.png">10</a>]</span>
this determination, indifference on his
part was changed into rudeness, or
something worse.</p>

<p>"He now seldom dined at home,
and continually returned at a late hour,
drunk, to bed. I retired to another
apartment; I was glad, I own, to
escape from his; for personal intimacy
without affection, seemed, to me the
most degrading, as well as the most
painful state in which a woman of any
taste, not to speak of the peculiar delicacy
of fostered sensibility, could be
placed. But my husband's fondness
for women was of the grossest kind,
and imagination was so wholly out of
the question, as to render his indulgences
of this sort entirely promiscuous,
and of the most brutal nature.
My health suffered, before my heart
was entirely estranged by the loath<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-11" id="BPg_2-11"></a>[<a href="images/v2-11.png">11</a>]</span>some
information; could I then have
returned to his sullied arms, but as a
victim to the prejudices of mankind,
who have made women the property of
their husbands? I discovered even,
by his conversation, when intoxicated,
that his favourites were wantons of the
lowest class, who could by their vulgar,
indecent mirth, which he called nature,
rouse his sluggish spirits. Meretricious
ornaments and manners were
necessary to attract his attention. He
seldom looked twice at a modest woman,
and sat silent in their company;
and the charms of youth and beauty
had not the slightest effect on his senses,
unless the possessors were initiated in
vice. His intimacy with profligate women,
and his habits of thinking, gave
him a contempt for female endowments;
and he would repeat, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-12" id="BPg_2-12"></a>[<a href="images/v2-12.png">12</a>]</span>
wine had loosed his tongue, most of the
common-place sarcasms levelled at
them, by men who do not allow them
to have minds, because mind would be
an impediment to gross enjoyment.
Men who are inferior to their fellow
men, are always most anxious to establish
their superiority over women.
But where are these reflections leading
me?</p>

<p>"Women who have lost their husband's
affection, are justly reproved for
neglecting their persons, and not taking
the same pains to keep, as to gain a
heart; but who thinks of giving the
same advice to men, though women
are continually stigmatized for being
attached to fops; and from the nature
of their education, are more susceptible
of disgust? Yet why a woman should
be expected to endure a sloven, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-13" id="BPg_2-13"></a>[<a href="images/v2-13.png">13</a>]</span>
more patience than a man, and magnanimously
to govern herself, I cannot
conceive; unless it be supposed arrogant
in her to look for respect as well as a
maintenance. It is not easy to be
pleased, because, after promising to
love, in different circumstances, we are
told that it is our duty. I cannot, I
am sure (though, when attending the
sick, I never felt disgust) forget my
own sensations, when rising with health
and spirit, and after scenting the sweet
morning, I have met my husband at
the breakfast table. The active attention
I had been giving to domestic regulations,
which were generally settled
before he rose, or a walk, gave a glow
to my countenance, that contrasted with
his squallid appearance. The squeamishness
of stomach alone, produced
by the last night's intemperance, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-14" id="BPg_2-14"></a>[<a href="images/v2-14.png">14</a>]</span>
he took no pains to conceal, destroyed
my appetite. I think I now see him
lolling in an arm-chair, in a dirty powdering
gown, soiled linen, ungartered
stockings, and tangled hair, yawning
and stretching himself. The newspaper
was immediately called for, if not
brought in on the tea-board, from
which he would scarcely lift his eyes
while I poured out the tea, excepting
to ask for some brandy to put into it, or
to declare that he could not eat. In
answer to any question, in his best humour,
it was a drawling 'What do
you say, child?' But if I demanded
money for the house expences, which I
put off till the last moment, his customary
reply, often prefaced with an
oath, was, 'Do you think me, madam,
made of money?'&mdash;The butcher,
the baker, must wait; and, what was<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-15" id="BPg_2-15"></a>[<a href="images/v2-15.png">15</a>]</span>
worse, I was often obliged to witness
his surly dismission of tradesmen, who
were in want of their money, and
whom I sometimes paid with the presents
my uncle gave me for my own
use.</p>

<p><ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">"</ins>At this juncture my father's mistress,
by terrifying his conscience, prevailed
on him to marry her; he was already
become a methodist; and my brother,
who now practised for himself, had discovered
a flaw in the settlement made
on my mother's children, which set it
aside, and he allowed my father, whose
distress made him submit to any thing,
a tithe of his own, or rather our fortune.</p>

<p><ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">"</ins>My sisters had left school, but were
unable to endure home, which my father's
wife rendered as disagreeable as
possible, to get rid of girls whom she<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-16" id="BPg_2-16"></a>[<a href="images/v2-16.png">16</a>]</span>
regarded as spies on her conduct. They
were accomplished, yet you can (may
you never be reduced to the same destitute
state!) scarcely conceive the trouble
I had to place them in the situation
of governesses, the only one in which
even a well-educated woman, with
more than ordinary talents, can struggle
for a subsistence; and even this is a
dependence next to menial. Is it then
surprising, that so many forlorn women,
with human passions and feelings, take
refuge in infamy? Alone in large mansions,
I say alone, because they had no
companions with whom they could converse
on equal terms, or from whom
they could expect the endearments of
affection, they grew melancholy, and
the sound of joy made them sad; and
the youngest, having a more delicate
frame, fell into a decline. It was with<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-17" id="BPg_2-17"></a>[<a href="images/v2-17.png">17</a>]</span>
great difficulty that I, who now almost
supported the house by loans from my
uncle, could prevail on the <i>master</i> of it,
to allow her a room to die in. I watched
her sick bed for some months, and then
closed her eyes, gentle spirit! for ever.
She was pretty, with very engaging
manners; yet had never an opportunity
to marry, excepting to a very old man.
She had abilities sufficient to have
shone in any profession, had there been
any professions for women, though she
shrunk at the name of milliner or mantua-maker
as degrading to a gentlewoman.
I would not term this feeling
false pride to any one but you, my
child, whom I fondly hope to see (yes;
I will indulge the hope for a moment!)
possessed of that energy of character
which gives dignity to any station; and
with that clear, firm spirit that will en<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-18" id="BPg_2-18"></a>[<a href="images/v2-18.png">18</a>]</span>able
you to choose a situation for yourself,
or submit to be classed in the lowest,
if it be the only one in which you
can be the mistress of your own actions.</p>

<p>"Soon after the death of my sister,
an incident occurred, to prove to me that
the heart of a libertine is dead to natural
affection; and to convince me,
that the being who has appeared all
tenderness, to gratify a selfish passion,
is as regardless of the innocent fruit of
it, as of the object, when the fit is over.
I had casually observed an old, mean-looking
woman, who called on my husband
every two or three months to receive
some money. One day entering
the passage of his little counting-house,
as she was going out, I
heard her say, 'The child is very weak;
she cannot live long, she will soon die<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-19" id="BPg_2-19"></a>[<a href="images/v2-19.png">19</a>]</span>
out of your way, so you need not grudge
her a little physic.'</p>

<p>"'So much the better,' he replied,
'and pray mind your own business,
good woman.'</p>

<p>"I was struck by his unfeeling, inhuman
tone of voice, and drew back,
determined when the woman came
again, to try to speak to her, not out
of curiosity, I had heard enough, but
with the hope of being useful to a poor,
outcast girl.</p>

<p>"A month or two elapsed before I
saw this woman again; and then she
had a child in her hand that tottered
along, scarcely able to sustain her own
weight. They were going away, to
return at the hour Mr. Venables was
expected; he was now from home. I
desired the woman to walk into the
parlour. She hesitated, yet obeyed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-20" id="BPg_2-20"></a>[<a href="images/v2-20.png">20</a>]</span>
I assured her that I should not mention
to my husband (the word seemed to
weigh on my respiration), that I had seen
her, or his child. The woman stared
at me with astonishment; and I turned
my eyes on the squalid object [that accompanied
her.] She could hardly support
herself, her complexion was sallow,
and her eyes inflamed, with an indescribable
look of cunning, mixed with
the wrinkles produced by the peevishness
of pain.</p>

<p>"<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">'</ins>Poor child!' I exclaimed. 'Ah!
you may well say poor child,' replied
the woman. 'I brought her here to see
whether he would have the heart to
look at her, and not get some advice.
I do not know what they deserve who
nursed her. Why, her legs bent under
her like a bow when she came to me,
and she has never been well since; but,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-21" id="BPg_2-21"></a>[<a href="images/v2-21.png">21</a>]</span>
if they were no better paid than I am,
it is not to be wondered at, sure
enough.'</p>

<p>"On further enquiry I was informed,
that this miserable spectacle was the
daughter of a servant, a country girl,
who caught Mr. Venables' eye, and
whom he seduced. On his marriage he
sent her away, her situation being too
visible. After her delivery, she was
thrown on the town; and died in an
hospital within the year. The babe
was sent to a parish-nurse, and afterwards
to this woman, who did not
seem much better; but what was to be
expected from such a close bargain?
She was only paid three shillings a week
for board and washing.</p>

<p>"The woman begged me to give her
some old clothes for the child, assuring
me, that she was almost afraid to ask<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-22" id="BPg_2-22"></a>[<a href="images/v2-22.png">22</a>]</span>
master for money to buy even a pair
of shoes.</p>

<p>"I grew sick at heart. And, fearing
Mr. Venables might enter, and oblige
me to express my abhorrence, I hastily
enquired where she lived, promised to
pay her two shillings a week more, and
to call on her in a day or two; putting
a trifle into her hand as a proof of my
good intention.</p>

<p>"If the state of this child affected me,
what were my feelings at a discovery I
made respecting Peggy&mdash;&mdash;?<a name="BFNanchor_22-A_6" id="BFNanchor_22-A_6"></a><a href="#BFootnote_22-A_6" class="fnanchor">[22-A]</a></p>

<h2><a name="BCHAP_X" id="BCHAP_X"></a>CHAP. X.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">My</span> father's situation was now so
distressing, that I prevailed on my uncle
to accompany me to visit him; and
to lend me his assistance, to prevent the
whole property of the family from becoming
the prey of my brother's rapacity;
for, to extricate himself out of
present difficulties, my father was totally
regardless of futurity. I took
down with me some presents for my
step-mother; it did not require an effort
for me to treat her with civility, or
to forget the past.</p>

<p>"This was the first time I had visited
my native village, since my marriage.
But with what different emotions did
I return from the busy world, with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-24" id="BPg_2-24"></a>[<a href="images/v2-24.png">24</a>]</span>
heavy weight of experience benumbing
my imagination, to scenes, that whispered
recollections of joy and hope
most eloquently to my heart! The
first scent of the wild flowers from the
heath, thrilled through my veins, awakening
every sense to pleasure. The icy
hand of despair seemed to be removed
from my bosom; and&mdash;forgetting my
husband&mdash;the nurtured visions of a romantic
mind, bursting on me with all
their original wildness and gay exuberance,
were again hailed as sweet realities.
I forgot, with equal facility,
that I ever felt sorrow, or knew care
in the country; while a transient rainbow
stole athwart the cloudy sky of despondency.
The picturesque form of
several favourite trees, and the porches
of rude cottages, with their smiling
hedges, were recognized with the glad<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-25" id="BPg_2-25"></a>[<a href="images/v2-25.png">25</a>]</span>some
playfulness of childish vivacity.
I could have kissed the chickens that
pecked on the common; and longed to
pat the cows, and frolic with the dogs
that sported on it. I gazed with delight
on the windmill, and thought it
lucky that it should be in motion, at
the moment I passed by; and entering
the dear green lane, which led directly
to the village, the sound of the well-known
rookery gave that sentimental
tinge to the varying sensations of my
active soul, which only served to
heighten the lustre of the luxuriant
scenery. But, spying, as I advanced,
the spire, peeping over the withered tops
of the aged elms that composed the
rookery, my thoughts flew immediately
to the church-yard, and tears of affection,
such was the effect of my imagination,
bedewed my mother's grave!<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-26" id="BPg_2-26"></a>[<a href="images/v2-26.png">26</a>]</span>
Sorrow gave place to devotional feelings.
I wandered through the church
in fancy, as I used sometimes to do on
a Saturday evening. I recollected with
what fervour I addressed the God of
my youth: and once more with rapturous
love looked above my sorrows
to the Father of nature. I pause&mdash;feeling
forcibly all the emotions I am describing;
and (reminded, as I register
my sorrows, of the sublime calm I have
felt, when in some tremendous solitude,
my soul rested on itself, and
seemed to fill the universe) I insensibly
breathe soft, hushing every wayward
emotion, as if fearing to sully with a
sigh, a contentment so extatic.</p>

<p>"Having settled my father's affairs,
and, by my exertions in his favour, made
my brother my sworn foe, I returned
to London. My husband's conduct<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-27" id="BPg_2-27"></a>[<a href="images/v2-27.png">27</a>]</span>
was now changed; I had during my
absence, received several affectionate,
penitential letters from him; and he
seemed on my arrival, to wish by his
behaviour to prove his sincerity. I
could not then conceive why he acted
thus; and, when the suspicion darted
into my head, that it might arise from
observing my increasing influence with
my uncle, I almost despised myself for
imagining that such a degree of debasing
selfishness could exist.</p>

<p>"He became, unaccountable as was
the change, tender and attentive; and,
attacking my weak side, made a confession
of his follies, and lamented the
embarrassments in which I, who merited
a far different fate, might be involved.
He besought me to aid him with my
counsel, praised my understanding, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-28" id="BPg_2-28"></a>[<a href="images/v2-28.png">28</a>]</span>
appealed to the tenderness of my
heart.</p>

<p>"This conduct only inspired me with
compassion. I wished to be his friend;
but love had spread his rosy pinions,
and fled far, far away; and had not
(like some exquisite perfumes, the fine
spirit of which is continually mingling
with the air) left a fragrance behind,
to mark where he had shook his wings.
My husband's renewed caresses then
became hateful to me; his brutality
was tolerable, compared to his distasteful
fondness. Still, compassion, and
the fear of insulting his supposed feelings,
by a want of sympathy, made
me dissemble, and do violence to my
delicacy. What a task!</p>

<p>"Those who support a system of
what I term false refinement, and will<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-29" id="BPg_2-29"></a>[<a href="images/v2-29.png">29</a>]</span>
not allow great part of love in the female,
as well as male breast, to spring
in some respects involuntarily, may not
admit that charms are as necessary to
feed the passion, as virtues to convert
the mellowing spirit into friendship. To
such observers I have nothing to say,
any more than to the moralists, who insist
that women ought to, and can love
their husbands, because it is their duty.
To you, my child, I may add, with a
heart tremblingly alive to your future
conduct, some observations, dictated
by my present feelings, on calmly reviewing
this period of my life. When
novelists or moralists praise as a virtue,
a woman's coldness of constitution, and
want of passion; and make her yield
to the ardour of her lover out of sheer
compassion, or to promote a frigid plan
of future comfort, I am disgusted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-30" id="BPg_2-30"></a>[<a href="images/v2-30.png">30</a>]</span>
They may be good women, in the ordinary
acceptation of the phrase, and do
no harm; but they appear to me not to
have those 'finely fashioned nerves,'
which render the senses exquisite. They
may possess tenderness; but they want
that fire of the imagination, which produces
<i>active</i> sensibility, and <i>positive</i> virtue.
How does the woman deserve to
be characterized, who marries one man,
with a heart and imagination devoted
to another? Is she not an object of
pity or contempt, when thus sacrilegiously
violating the purity of her own
feelings? Nay, it is as indelicate, when
she is indifferent, unless she be constitutionally
insensible; then indeed it is
a mere affair of barter; and I have nothing
to do with the secrets of trade.
Yes; eagerly as I wish you to possess
true rectitude of mind, and purity of<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-31" id="BPg_2-31"></a>[<a href="images/v2-31.png">31</a>]</span>
affection, I must insist that a heartless
conduct is the contrary of virtuous.
Truth is the only basis of virtue; and
we cannot, without depraving our
minds, endeavour to please a lover or
husband, but in proportion as he
pleases us. Men, more effectually to
enslave us, may inculcate this partial
morality, and lose sight of virtue in
subdividing it into the duties of particular
stations; but let us not blush for
nature without a cause!</p>

<p>"After these remarks, I am ashamed
to own, that I was pregnant. The
greatest sacrifice of my principles in my
whole life, was the allowing my husband
again to be familiar with my person,
though to this cruel act of self-denial,
when I wished the earth to
open and swallow me, you owe your
birth; and I the unutterable pleasure<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-32" id="BPg_2-32"></a>[<a href="images/v2-32.png">32</a>]</span>
of being a mother. There was something
of delicacy in my husband's bridal
attentions; but now his tainted breath,
pimpled face, and blood-shot eyes,
were not more repugnant to my senses,
than his gross manners, and loveless
familiarity to my taste.</p>

<p>"A man would only be expected to
maintain; yes, barely grant a subsistence,
to a woman rendered odious by
habitual intoxication; but who would
expect him, or think it possible to love
her? And unless 'youth, and genial
years were flown,' it would be thought
equally unreasonable to insist, [under
penalty of] forfeiting almost every thing
reckoned valuable in life, that he
should not love another: whilst woman,
weak in reason, impotent in will,
is required to moralize, sentimentalize
herself to stone, and pine her life away,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-33" id="BPg_2-33"></a>[<a href="images/v2-33.png">33</a>]</span>
labouring to reform her embruted
mate. He may even spend in dissipation,
and intemperance, the very intemperance
which renders him so hateful,
her property, and by stinting her
expences, not permit her to beguile in
society, a wearisome, joyless life; for
over their mutual fortune she has no
power, it must all pass through his
hand. And if she be a mother, and
in the present state of women, it is a
great misfortune to be prevented from
discharging the duties, and cultivating
the affections of one, what has she not
to endure?&mdash;But I have suffered the
tenderness of one to lead me into reflections
that I did not think of making,
to interrupt my narrative&mdash;yet the full
heart will overflow.</p>

<p>"Mr. Venables' embarrassments did
not now endear him to me; still, anxi<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-34" id="BPg_2-34"></a>[<a href="images/v2-34.png">34</a>]</span>ous
to befriend him, I endeavoured to
prevail on him to retrench his expences;
but he had always some plausible
excuse to give, to justify his not
following my advice. Humanity, compassion,
and the interest produced by a
habit of living together, made me try
to relieve, and sympathize with him;
but, when I recollected that I was
bound to live with such a being for
ever&mdash;my heart died within me; my
desire of improvement became languid,
and baleful, corroding melancholy took
possession of my soul. Marriage had
bastilled me for life. I discovered in
myself a capacity for the enjoyment of
the various pleasures existence affords;
yet, fettered by the partial laws of society,
this fair globe was to me an
universal blank.</p>

<p>"When I exhorted my husband to<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-35" id="BPg_2-35"></a>[<a href="images/v2-35.png">35</a>]</span>
economy, I referred to himself. I was
obliged to practise the most rigid, or
contract debts, which I had too much
reason to fear would never be paid. I
despised this paltry privilege of a wife,
which can only be of use to the vicious
or inconsiderate, and determined not to
increase the torrent that was bearing
him down. I was then ignorant of
the extent of his fraudulent speculations,
whom I was bound to honour
and obey.</p>

<p>"A woman neglected by her husband,
or whose manners form a striking
contrast with his, will always have
men on the watch to soothe and flatter
her. Besides, the forlorn state of a
neglected woman, not destitute of personal
charms, is particularly interesting,
and rouses that species of pity,
which is so near akin, it easily slides<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-36" id="BPg_2-36"></a>[<a href="images/v2-36.png">36</a>]</span>
into love. A man of feeling thinks
not of seducing, he is himself seduced
by all the noblest emotions of his soul.
He figures to himself all the sacrifices a
woman of sensibility must make, and
every situation in which his imagination
places her, touches his heart,
and fires his passions. Longing to
take to his bosom the shorn lamb, and
bid the drooping buds of hope revive,
benevolence changes into passion:
and should he then discover that he is
beloved, honour binds him fast, though
foreseeing that he may afterwards be
obliged to pay severe damages to the
man, who never appeared to value his
wife's society, till he found that there
was a chance of his being indemnified
for the loss of it.</p>

<p>"Such are the partial laws enacted
by men; for, only to lay a stress on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-37" id="BPg_2-37"></a>[<a href="images/v2-37.png">37</a>]</span>
dependent state of a woman in the
grand question of the comforts arising
from the possession of property, she is
[even in this article] much more injured
by the loss of the husband's affection,
than he by that of his wife; yet where
is she, condemned to the solitude of a
deserted home, to look for a compensation
from the woman, who seduces
him from her? She cannot drive an
unfaithful husband from his house, nor
separate, or tear, his children from
him, however culpable he may be; and
he, still the master of his own fate, enjoys
the smiles of a world, that would
brand her with infamy, did she, seeking
consolation, venture to retaliate.</p>

<p>"These remarks are not dictated by
experience; but merely by the compassion
I feel for many amiable women,
the <i>out-laws</i> of the world. For my<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-38" id="BPg_2-38"></a>[<a href="images/v2-38.png">38</a>]</span>self,
never encouraging any of the advances
that were made to me, my lovers
dropped off like the untimely shoots of
spring. I did not even coquet with
them; because I found, on examining
myself, I could not coquet with a man
without loving him a little; and I perceived
that I should not be able to
stop at the line of what are termed <i>innocent
freedoms</i>, did I suffer any. My
reserve was then the consequence of
delicacy. Freedom of conduct has
emancipated many women's minds;
but my conduct has most rigidly been
governed by my principles, till the improvement
of my understanding has
enabled me to discern the fallacy of
prejudices at war with nature and
reason.</p>

<p>"Shortly after the change I have
mentioned in my husband's conduct,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-39" id="BPg_2-39"></a>[<a href="images/v2-39.png">39</a>]</span>
my uncle was compelled by his declining
health, to seek the succour of a
milder climate, and embark for Lisbon.
He left his will in the hands of a friend,
an eminent solicitor; he had previously
questioned me relative to my situation
and state of mind, and declared very
freely, that he could place no reliance
on the stability of my husband's professions.
He had been deceived in the
unfolding of his character; he now
thought it fixed in a train of actions
that would inevitably lead to ruin and
disgrace.</p>

<p>"The evening before his departure,
which we spent alone together, he
folded me to his heart, uttering the endearing
appellation of 'child.'&mdash;My
more than father! why was I not permitted
to perform the last duties of
one, and smooth the pillow of death?<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-40" id="BPg_2-40"></a>[<a href="images/v2-40.png">40</a>]</span>
He seemed by his manner to be convinced
that he should never see me
more; yet requested me, most earnestly,
to come to him, should I be obliged to
leave my husband. He had before expressed
his sorrow at hearing of my
pregnancy, having determined to prevail
on me to accompany him, till I
informed him of that circumstance. He
expressed himself unfeignedly sorry that
any new tie should bind me to a man
whom he thought so incapable of estimating
my value; such was the kind
language of affection.</p>

<p>"I must repeat his own words; they
made an indelible impression on my
mind:</p>

<p>"'The marriage state is certainly that
in which women, generally speaking,
can be most useful; but I am far from
thinking that a woman, once married,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-41" id="BPg_2-41"></a>[<a href="images/v2-41.png">41</a>]</span>
ought to consider the engagement as
indissoluble (especially if there be no
children to reward her for sacrificing
her feelings) in case her husband
merits neither her love, nor esteem.
Esteem will often supply the place of
love; and prevent a woman from being
wretched, though it may not
make her happy. The magnitude of
a sacrifice ought always to bear some
proportion to the utility in view;
and for a woman to live with a man,
for whom she can cherish neither affection
nor esteem, or even be of any
use to him, excepting in the light of
a house-keeper, is an abjectness of
condition, the enduring of which no
concurrence of circumstances can
ever make a duty in the sight of God
or just men. If indeed she submits to
it merely to be maintained in idleness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-42" id="BPg_2-42"></a>[<a href="images/v2-42.png">42</a>]</span>
she has no right to complain bitterly
of her fate; or to act, as a person of
independent character might, as if
she had a title to disregard general
rules.</p>

<p>"<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">'</ins>But the misfortune is, that many
women only submit in appearance,
and forfeit their own respect to secure
their reputation in the world. The
situation of a woman separated from
her husband, is undoubtedly very different
from that of a man who has
left his wife. He, with lordly dignity,
has shaken of a clog; and the allowing
her food and raiment, is
thought sufficient to secure his reputation
from taint. And, should she
have been inconsiderate, he will be
celebrated for his generosity and forbearance.
Such is the respect paid to
the master-key of property! A wo<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-43" id="BPg_2-43"></a>[<a href="images/v2-43.png">43</a>]</span>man,
on the contrary, resigning what
is termed her natural protector (though
he never was so, but in name) is
despised and shunned, for asserting
the independence of mind distinctive
of a rational being, and spurning at
slavery.'</p>

<p>"During the remainder of the evening,
my uncle's tenderness led him frequently
to revert to the subject, and
utter, with increasing warmth, sentiments
to the same purport. At length
it was necessary to say 'Farewell!'&mdash;and
we parted&mdash;gracious God! to meet no
more.</p>

<h2><a name="BCHAP_XI" id="BCHAP_XI"></a>CHAP. XI.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">A gentleman</span> of large fortune
and of polished manners, had lately
visited very frequently at our house,
and treated me, if possible, with more
respect than Mr. Venables paid him;
my pregnancy was not yet visible,
his society was a great relief to me, as
I had for some time past, to avoid expence,
confined myself very much at
home. I ever disdained unnecessary,
perhaps even prudent concealments;
and my husband, with great ease, discovered
the amount of my uncle's parting
present. A copy of a writ was the
stale pretext to extort it from me; and
I had soon reason to believe that it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-45" id="BPg_2-45"></a>[<a href="images/v2-45.png">45</a>]</span>
fabricated for the purpose. I acknowledge
my folly in thus suffering myself
to be continually imposed on. I had
adhered to my resolution not to apply
to my uncle, on the part of my husband,
any more; yet, when I had received
a sum sufficient to supply my own
wants, and to enable me to pursue a
plan I had in view, to settle my younger
brother in a respectable employment,
I allowed myself to be duped by
Mr. Venables' shallow pretences, and
hypocritical professions.</p>

<p>"Thus did he pillage me and my
family, thus frustrate all my plans of
usefulness. Yet this was the man I was
bound to respect and esteem: as if respect
and esteem depended on an arbitrary
will of our own! But a wife being
as much a man's property as his
horse, or his ass, she has nothing she<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-46" id="BPg_2-46"></a>[<a href="images/v2-46.png">46</a>]</span>
can call her own. He may use any
means to get at what the law considers
as his, the moment his wife is in
possession of it, even to the forcing of
a lock, as Mr. Venables did, to search
for notes in my writing-desk&mdash;and all
this is done with a show of equity, because,
forsooth, he is responsible for
her maintenance.</p>

<p>"The tender mother cannot <i>lawfully</i>
snatch from the gripe of the
gambling spendthrift, or beastly
drunkard, unmindful of his offspring,
the fortune which falls to her by
chance; or (so flagrant is the injustice)
what she earns by her own exertions.
No; he can rob her with impunity,
even to waste publicly on a courtezan;
and the laws of her country&mdash;if women
have a country&mdash;afford her no protection
or redress from the oppressor, un<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-47" id="BPg_2-47"></a>[<a href="images/v2-47.png">47</a>]</span>less
she have the plea of bodily fear;
yet how many ways are there of goading
the soul almost to madness, equally
unmanly, though not so mean? When
such laws were framed, should not
impartial lawgivers have first decreed,
in the style of a great assembly, who recognized
the existence of an <i>&ecirc;tre supr&ecirc;me</i>,
to fix the national belief, that
the husband should always be wiser and
more virtuous than his wife, in order
to entitle him, with a show of justice,
to keep this idiot, or perpetual minor,
for ever in bondage. But I must have
done&mdash;on this subject, my indignation
continually runs away with me.</p>

<p>"The company of the gentleman I
have already mentioned, who had a
general acquaintance with literature
and subjects of taste, was grateful to
me; my countenance brightened up as<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-48" id="BPg_2-48"></a>[<a href="images/v2-48.png">48</a>]</span>
he approached, and I unaffectedly
expressed the pleasure I felt. The
amusement his conversation afforded
me, made it easy to comply with my
husband's request, to endeavour to render
our house agreeable to him.</p>

<p>"His attentions became more
pointed; but, as I was not of the
number of women, whose virtue, as
it is termed, immediately takes alarm,
I endeavoured, rather by raillery than
serious expostulation, to give a different
turn to his conversation. He assumed a
new mode of attack, and I was, for a
while, the dupe of his pretended
friendship.</p>

<p>"I had, merely in the style of <i>badinage</i>,
boasted of my conquest, and repeated
his lover-like compliments to
my husband. But he begged me, for
God's sake, not to affront his friend, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-49" id="BPg_2-49"></a>[<a href="images/v2-49.png">49</a>]</span>
I should destroy all his projects, and be
his ruin. Had I had more affection for
my husband, I should have expressed
my contempt of this time-serving politeness:
now I imagined that I only
felt pity; yet it would have puzzled a
casuist to point out in what the exact
difference consisted.</p>

<p>"This friend began now, in confidence,
to discover to me the real state
of my husband's affairs. 'Necessity,'
said Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;; why should I reveal
his name? for he affected to palliate the
conduct he could not excuse, 'had
led him to take such steps, by accommodation
bills, buying goods on credit,
to sell them for ready money, and similar
transactions, that his character in
the commercial world was gone. He
was considered,' he added, lowering
his voice, 'on 'Change as a swindler.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-50" id="BPg_2-50"></a>[<a href="images/v2-50.png">50</a>]</span>
"I felt at that moment the first maternal
pang. Aware of the evils my
sex have to struggle with, I still wished,
for my own consolation, to be the mother
of a daughter; and I could not
bear to think, that the <i>sins</i> of her father's
entailed disgrace, should be added
to the ills to which woman is heir.</p>

<p>"So completely was I deceived by
these shows of friendship (nay, I believe,
according to his interpretation, Mr. S&mdash;
really was my friend) that I began
to consult him respecting the best mode
of retrieving my husband's character:
it is the good name of a woman only
that sets to rise no more. I knew
not that he had been drawn into a
whirlpool, out of which he had not
the energy to attempt to escape. He
seemed indeed destitute of the power
of employing his faculties in any regu<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-51" id="BPg_2-51"></a>[<a href="images/v2-51.png">51</a>]</span>lar
pursuit. His principles of action
were so loose, and his mind so uncultivated,
that every thing like order appeared
to him in the shape of restraint;
and, like men in the savage state, he
required the strong stimulus of hope
or fear, produced by wild speculations,
in which the interests of others went
for nothing, to keep his spirits awake.
He one time possessed patriotism, but
he knew not what it was to feel honest
indignation; and pretended to be an advocate
for liberty, when, with as little
affection for the human race as for individuals,
he thought of nothing but
his own gratification. He was just
such a citizen, as a father. The sums
he adroitly obtained by a violation of
the laws of his country, as well as
those of humanity, he would allow a
mistress to squander; though she was,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-52" id="BPg_2-52"></a>[<a href="images/v2-52.png">52</a>]</span>
with the same <i>sang froid</i>, consigned, as
were his children, to poverty, when
another proved more attractive.</p>

<p>"On various pretences, his friend
continued to visit me; and, observing
my want of money, he tried to induce
me to accept of pecuniary aid; but this
offer I absolutely rejected, though it
was made with such delicacy, I could
not be displeased.</p>

<p>"One day he came, as I thought
accidentally, to dinner. My husband
was very much engaged in business,
and quitted the room soon after the
cloth was removed. We conversed as
usual, till confidential advice led again
to love. I was extremely mortified.
I had a sincere regard for him, and
hoped that he had an equal friendship
for me. I therefore began mildly to
expostulate with him. This gentle<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-53" id="BPg_2-53"></a>[<a href="images/v2-53.png">53</a>]</span>ness
he mistook for coy encouragement;
and he would not be diverted
from the subject. Perceiving his mistake,
I seriously asked him how, using
such language to me, he could profess
to be my husband's friend? A significant
sneer excited my curiosity, and he,
supposing this to be my only scruple,
took a letter deliberately out of his
pocket, saying, 'Your husband's honour
is not inflexible. How could you,
with your discernment, think it so?
Why, he left the room this very day
on purpose to give me an opportunity
to explain myself; <i>he</i> thought me too
timid&mdash;too tardy.<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">'</ins></p>

<p>"I snatched the letter with indescribable
emotion. The purport of it
was to invite him to dinner, and to ridicule
his chivalrous respect for me.
He assured him, 'that every woman had<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-54" id="BPg_2-54"></a>[<a href="images/v2-54.png">54</a>]</span>
her price, and, with gross indecency,
hinted, that he should be glad to have
the duty of a husband taken off his
hands. These he termed <i>liberal sentiments</i>.
He advised him not to shock my
romantic notions, but to attack my
credulous generosity, and weak pity;
and concluded with requesting him to
lend him five hundred pounds for a
month or six weeks.' I read this letter
twice over; and the firm purpose it inspired,
calmed the rising tumult of my
soul. I rose deliberately, requested
Mr. S&mdash;&mdash; to wait a moment, and instantly
going into the counting-house,
desired Mr. Venables to return with me
to the dining-parlour.</p>

<p>"He laid down his pen, and entered
with me, without observing any change
in my countenance. I shut the door,
and, giving him the letter, simply<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-55" id="BPg_2-55"></a>[<a href="images/v2-55.png">55</a>]</span>
asked, 'whether he wrote it, or was it
a forgery?'</p>

<p>"Nothing could equal his confusion.
His friend's eye met his, and
he muttered something about a joke&mdash;But
I interrupted him&mdash;'It is sufficient&mdash;We
part for ever.'</p>

<p>"I continued, with solemnity, 'I
have borne with your tyranny and infidelities.
I disdain to utter what I
have borne with. I thought you unprincipled,
but not so decidedly
vicious. I formed a tie, in the sight of
heaven&mdash;I have held it sacred; even
when men, more conformable to my
taste, have made me feel&mdash;I despise all
subterfuge!&mdash;that I was not dead to
love. Neglected by you, I have resolutely
stifled the enticing emotions, and
respected the plighted faith you outraged.
And you dare now to insult<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-56" id="BPg_2-56"></a>[<a href="images/v2-56.png">56</a>]</span>
me, by selling me to prostitution!&mdash;Yes&mdash;equally
lost to delicacy and principle&mdash;you
dared sacrilegiously to barter
the honour of the mother of your
child.'</p>

<p>"Then, turning to Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;, I
added, 'I call on you, Sir, to witness,'
and I lifted my hands and eyes to heaven,
'that, as solemnly as I took his
name, I now abjure it,' I pulled off my
ring, and put it on the table; 'and that
I mean immediately to quit his house,
never to enter it more. I will provide
for myself and child. I leave him as
free as I am determined to be myself&mdash;he
shall be answerable for no debts of
mine.'</p>

<p>"Astonishment closed their lips, till
Mr. Venables, gently pushing his
friend, with a forced smile, out of the
room, nature for a moment prevailed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-57" id="BPg_2-57"></a>[<a href="images/v2-57.png">57</a>]</span>
and, appearing like himself, he turned
round, burning with rage, to me:
but there was no terror in the frown,
excepting when contrasted with the
malignant smile which preceded it.
He bade me 'leave the house at my
peril; told me he despised my threats;
I had no resource; I could not swear the
peace against him!&mdash;I was not afraid of
my life!&mdash;he had never struck me!'</p>

<p>"He threw the letter in the fire,
which I had incautiously left in his
hands; and, quitting the room, locked
the door on me.</p>

<p>"When left alone, I was a moment
or two before I could recollect myself.
One scene had succeeded another with
such rapidity, I almost doubted whether
I was reflecting on a real event.
'Was it possible? Was I, indeed,
free?'&mdash;Yes; free I termed myself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-58" id="BPg_2-58"></a>[<a href="images/v2-58.png">58</a>]</span>
when I decidedly perceived the conduct
I ought to adopt. How had I panted
for liberty&mdash;liberty, that I would have
purchased at any price, but that of my
own esteem! I rose, and shook myself;
opened the window, and methought
the air never smelled so sweet. The face
of heaven grew fairer as I viewed it,
and the clouds seemed to flit away obedient
to my wishes, to give my soul
room to expand. I was all soul, and
(wild as it may appear) felt as if I
could have dissolved in the soft balmy
gale that kissed my cheek, or have
glided below the horizon on the glowing,
descending beams. A seraphic satisfaction
animated, without agitating
my spirits; and my imagination collected,
in visions sublimely terrible, or
soothingly beautiful, an immense variety
of the endless images, which nature<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-59" id="BPg_2-59"></a>[<a href="images/v2-59.png">59</a>]</span>
affords, and fancy combines, of the
grand and fair. The lustre of these
bright picturesque sketches faded with
the setting sun; but I was still alive to
the calm delight they had diffused
through my heart.</p>

<p>"There may be advocates for matrimonial
obedience, who, making a distinction
between the duty of a wife and
of a human being, may blame my conduct.&mdash;To
them I write not&mdash;my feelings
are not for them to analyze; and
may you, my child, never be able to
ascertain, by heart-rending experience,
what your mother felt before the present
emancipation of her mind!</p>

<p>"I began to write a letter to my father,
after closing one to my uncle;
not to ask advice, but to signify my determination;
when I was interrupted
by the entrance of Mr. Venables. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-60" id="BPg_2-60"></a>[<a href="images/v2-60.png">60</a>]</span>
manner was changed. His views on
my uncle's fortune made him averse to
my quitting his house, or he would, I
am convinced, have been glad to have
shaken off even the slight restraint my
presence imposed on him; the restraint
of showing me some respect. So far
from having an affection for me, he
really hated me, because he was convinced
that I must despise him.</p>

<p>"He told me, that, 'As I now had
had time to cool and reflect, he did not
doubt but that my prudence, and nice
sense of propriety, would lead me to
overlook what was passed.'</p>

<p>"'Reflection,' I replied, 'had only
confirmed my purpose, and no power
on earth could divert me from it.'</p>

<p>"Endeavouring to assume a soothing
voice and look, when he would willingly
have tortured me, to force me to<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-61" id="BPg_2-61"></a>[<a href="images/v2-61.png">61</a>]</span>
feel his power, his countenance had an
infernal expression, when he desired me,
'Not to expose myself to the servants,
by obliging him to confine me in my
apartment; if then I would give my
promise not to quit the house precipitately,
I should be free&mdash;and&mdash;.' I declared,
interrupting him, 'that I would
promise nothing. I had no measures
to keep with him&mdash;I was resolved, and
would not condescend to subterfuge.'</p>

<p>"He muttered, 'that I should soon
repent of these preposterous airs;' and,
ordering tea to be carried into my little
study, which had a communication with
my bed-chamber, he once more locked
the door upon me, and left me to my
own meditations. I had passively followed
him up stairs, not wishing to fatigue
myself with unavailing exertion.</p>

<p>"Nothing calms the mind like a<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-62" id="BPg_2-62"></a>[<a href="images/v2-62.png">62</a>]</span>
fixed purpose. I felt as if I had heaved
a thousand weight from my heart; the
atmosphere seemed lightened; and, if
I execrated the institutions of society,
which thus enable men to tyrannize
over women, it was almost a disinterested
sentiment. I disregarded present
inconveniences, when my mind had
done struggling with itself,&mdash;when reason
and inclination had shaken hands
and were at peace. I had no longer
the cruel task before me, in endless perspective,
aye, during the tedious
for ever of life, of labouring to
overcome my repugnance&mdash;of labouring
to extinguish the hopes, the maybes
of a lively imagination. Death I
had hailed as my only chance for deliverance;
but, while existence had still
so many charms, and life promised
happiness, I shrunk from the icy arms<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-63" id="BPg_2-63"></a>[<a href="images/v2-63.png">63</a>]</span>
of an unknown tyrant, though far more
inviting than those of the man, to whom I
supposed myself bound without any other
alternative; and was content to linger
a little longer, waiting for I knew not
what, rather than leave 'the warm
precincts of the cheerful day,' and all
the unenjoyed affection of my nature.</p>

<p>"My present situation gave a new
turn to my reflection; and I wondered
(now the film seemed to be withdrawn,
that obscured the piercing sight of reason)
how I could, previously to the deciding
outrage, have considered myself
as everlastingly united to vice and folly?
'Had an evil genius cast a spell at my
birth; or a demon stalked out of chaos,
to perplex my understanding, and enchain
my will, with delusive prejudices?'</p>

<p>"I pursued this train of thinking; it<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-64" id="BPg_2-64"></a>[<a href="images/v2-64.png">64</a>]</span>
led me out of myself, to expatiate on
the misery peculiar to my sex. 'Are
not,' I thought, 'the despots for ever
stigmatized, who, in the wantonness of
power, commanded even the most atrocious
criminals to be chained to dead
bodies? though surely those laws are
much more inhuman, which forge adamantine
fetters to bind minds together,
that never can mingle in social communion!
What indeed can equal the
wretchedness of that state, in which
there is no alternative, but to extinguish
the affections, or encounter infamy?'</p>

<h2><a name="BCHAP_XII" id="BCHAP_XII"></a>CHAP. XII.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Towards</span> midnight Mr. Venables
entered my chamber; and, with
calm audacity preparing to go to bed,
he bade me make haste, 'for that was
the best place for husbands and wives
to end their differences. He had been
drinking plentifully to aid his courage.</p>

<p>"I did not at first deign to reply.
But perceiving that he affected to take
my silence for consent, I told him that,
'If he would not go to another bed, or
allow me, I should sit up in my study
all night.' He attempted to pull me
into the chamber, half joking. But I
resisted; and, as he had determined not
to give me any reason for saying that
he used violence, after a few more ef<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-66" id="BPg_2-66"></a>[<a href="images/v2-66.png">66</a>]</span>forts,
he retired, cursing my obstinacy,
to bed.</p>

<p>"I sat musing some time longer; then,
throwing my cloak around me, prepared
for sleep on a sopha. And, so fortunate
seemed my deliverance, so sacred
the pleasure of being thus wrapped up
in myself, that I slept profoundly, and
woke with a mind composed to encounter
the struggles of the day. Mr.
Venables did not wake till some hours
after; and then he came to me half-dressed,
yawning and stretching, with
haggard eyes, as if he scarcely recollected
what had passed the preceding
evening. He fixed his eyes on me for
a moment, then, calling me a fool,
asked 'How long I intended to continue
this pretty farce? For his part, he
was devilish sick of it; but this was the
plague of marrying women who pretended
to know something.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-67" id="BPg_2-67"></a>[<a href="images/v2-67.png">67</a>]</span>
"I made no other reply to this harangue,
than to say, 'That he ought to
be glad to get rid of a woman so unfit
to be his companion&mdash;and that any
change in my conduct would be mean
dissimulation; for maturer reflection
only gave the sacred seal of reason to
my first resolution.'</p>

<p>"He looked as if he could have
stamped with impatience, at being
obliged to stifle his rage; but, conquering
his anger (for weak people, whose
passions seem the most ungovernable,
restrain them with the greatest ease,
when they have a sufficient motive), he
exclaimed, 'Very pretty, upon my
soul! very pretty, theatrical flourishes!
Pray, fair Roxana, stoop from your altitudes,
and remember that you are
acting a part in real life.'</p>

<p>"He uttered this speech with a self-<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-68" id="BPg_2-68"></a>[<a href="images/v2-68.png">68</a>]</span>satisfied
air, and went down stairs to
dress.</p>

<p>"In about an hour he came to me
again; and in the same tone said, 'That
he came as my gentleman-usher to hand
me down to breakfast.</p>

<p>"'Of the black rod?' asked I.</p>

<p>"This question, and the tone in
which I asked it, a little disconcerted
him. To say the truth, I now felt no
resentment; my firm resolution to free
myself from my ignoble thraldom, had
absorbed the various emotions which,
during six years, had racked my soul.
The duty pointed out by my principles
seemed clear; and not one tender feeling
intruded to make me swerve: The
dislike which my husband had inspired
was strong; but it only led me to wish
to avoid, to wish to let him drop out of
my memory; there was no misery, no<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-69" id="BPg_2-69"></a>[<a href="images/v2-69.png">69</a>]</span>
torture that I would not deliberately
have chosen, rather than renew my
lease of servitude.</p>

<p>"During the breakfast, he attempted
to reason with me on the folly of romantic
sentiments; for this was the indiscriminate
epithet he gave to every
mode of conduct or thinking superior
to his own. He asserted, 'that all the
world were governed by their own interest;
those who pretended to be actuated
by different motives, were only
deeper knaves, or fools crazed by books,
who took for gospel all the rodomantade
nonsense written by men who
knew nothing of the world. For his
part, he thanked God, he was no hypocrite;
and, if he stretched a point
sometimes, it was always with an intention
of paying every man his own.'</p>

<p>"He then artfully insinuated, 'that<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-70" id="BPg_2-70"></a>[<a href="images/v2-70.png">70</a>]</span>
he daily expected a vessel to arrive, a
successful speculation, that would make
him easy for the present, and that he
had several other schemes actually depending,
that could not fail. He had
no doubt of becoming rich in a few
years, though he had been thrown back
by some unlucky adventures at the setting
out.'</p>

<p>"I mildly replied, 'That I wished he
might not involve himself still deeper.'</p>

<p>"He had no notion that I was governed
by a decision of judgment, not
to be compared with a mere spurt of
resentment. He knew not what it was
to feel indignation against vice, and
often boasted of his placable temper,
and readiness to forgive injuries. True;
for he only considered the being deceived,
as an effort of skill he had not
guarded against; and then, with a cant<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-71" id="BPg_2-71"></a>[<a href="images/v2-71.png">71</a>]</span>
of candour, would observe, 'that he
did not know how he might himself
have been tempted to act in the same
circumstances.' And, as his heart
never opened to friendship, it never was
wounded by disappointment. Every
new acquaintance he protested, it is
true, was 'the cleverest fellow in the
world;<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">'</ins> and he really thought so; till
the novelty of his conversation or manners
ceased to have any effect on his
sluggish spirits. His respect for rank or
fortune was more permanent, though
he chanced to have no design of availing
himself of the influence of either
to promote his own views.</p>

<p>"After a prefatory conversation,&mdash;my
blood (I thought it had been cooler)
flushed over my whole countenance as
he spoke&mdash;he alluded to my situation.
He desired me to reflect&mdash;'and act like<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-72" id="BPg_2-72"></a>[<a href="images/v2-72.png">72</a>]</span>
a prudent woman, as the best proof of
my superior understanding; for he must
own I had sense, did I know how to
use it. I was not,' he laid a stress on
his words, 'without my passions; and
a husband was a convenient cloke.&mdash;He
was liberal in his way of thinking;
and why might not we, like many other
married people, who were above vulgar
prejudices, tacitly consent to let
each other follow their own inclination?&mdash;He
meant nothing more, in the
letter I made the ground of complaint;
and the pleasure which I seemed to
take in Mr. S.'s company, led him to
conclude, that he was not disagreeable
to me.'</p>

<p>"A clerk brought in the letters of
the day, and I, as I often did, while
he was discussing subjects of business,
went to the <i>piano forte</i>, and began to<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-73" id="BPg_2-73"></a>[<a href="images/v2-73.png">73</a>]</span>
play a favourite air to restore myself,
as it were, to nature, and drive the
sophisticated sentiments I had just been
obliged to listen to, out of my soul.</p>

<p>"They had excited sensations similar
to those I have felt, in viewing the squalid
inhabitants of some of the lanes and
back streets of the metropolis, mortified
at being compelled to consider
them as my fellow-creatures, as if an
ape had claimed kindred with me. Or,
as when surrounded by a mephitical fog,
I have wished to have a volley of cannon
fired, to clear the incumbered atmosphere,
and give me room to breathe
and move.</p>

<p>"My spirits were all in arms, and I
played a kind of extemporary prelude.
The cadence was probably wild and
impassioned, while, lost in thought, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-74" id="BPg_2-74"></a>[<a href="images/v2-74.png">74</a>]</span>
made the sounds a kind of echo to my
train of thinking.</p>

<p>"Pausing for a moment, I met Mr.
Venables' eyes. He was observing me
with an air of conceited satisfaction, as
much as to say&mdash;'My last insinuation
has done the business&mdash;she begins to
know her own interest.' Then gathering
up his letters, he said, 'That
he hoped he should hear no more romantic
stuff, well enough in a miss
just come from boarding school;' and
went, as was his custom, to the counting-house.
I still continued playing;
and, turning to a sprightly lesson, I
executed it with uncommon vivacity.
I heard footsteps approach the door,
and was soon convinced that Mr. Venables
was listening; the consciousness
only gave more animation to my
fingers. He went down into the kit<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-75" id="BPg_2-75"></a>[<a href="images/v2-75.png">75</a>]</span>chen,
and the cook, probably by his
desire, came to me, to know what I
would please to order for dinner. Mr.
Venables came into the parlour again,
with apparent carelessness. I perceived
that the cunning man was over-reaching
himself; and I gave my directions
as usual, and left the room.</p>

<p>"While I was making some alteration
in my dress, Mr. Venables peeped
in, and, begging my pardon for interrupting
me, disappeared. I took
up some work (I could not read), and
two or three messages were sent to me,
probably for no other purpose, but to
enable Mr. Venables to ascertain what
I was about.</p>

<p>"I listened whenever I heard the
street-door open; at last I imagined I
could distinguish Mr. Venables' step,
going out. I laid aside my work; my<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-76" id="BPg_2-76"></a>[<a href="images/v2-76.png">76</a>]</span>
heart palpitated; still I was afraid
hastily to enquire; and I waited a long
half hour, before I ventured to ask the
boy whether his master was in the
counting-house?</p>

<p>"Being answered in the negative,
I bade him call me a coach, and collecting
a few necessaries hastily together,
with a little parcel of letters and
papers which I had collected the preceding
evening, I hurried into it, desiring
the coachman to drive to a distant
part of the town.</p>

<p>"I almost feared that the coach
would break down before I got out of
the street; and, when I turned the
corner, I seemed to breathe a freer air.
I was ready to imagine that I was rising
above the thick atmosphere of earth;
or I felt, as wearied souls might be sup<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-77" id="BPg_2-77"></a>[<a href="images/v2-77.png">77</a>]</span>posed
to feel on entering another state
of existence.</p>

<p>"I stopped at one or two stands of
coaches to elude pursuit, and then
drove round the skirts of the town to
seek for an obscure lodging, where I
wished to remain concealed, till I could
avail myself of my uncle's protection.
I had resolved to assume my own name
immediately, and openly to avow my
determination, without any formal vindication,
the moment I had found a
home, in which I could rest free from
the daily alarm of expecting to see
Mr. Venables enter.</p>

<p>"I looked at several lodgings; but
finding that I could not, without a reference
to some acquaintance, who
might inform my tyrant, get admittance
into a decent apartment&mdash;men
have not all this trouble&mdash;I thought of<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-78" id="BPg_2-78"></a>[<a href="images/v2-78.png">78</a>]</span>
a woman whom I had assisted to furnish
a little haberdasher's shop, and
who I knew had a first floor to let.</p>

<p>"I went to her, and though I could
not persuade her, that the quarrel between
me and Mr. Venables would
never be made up, still she agreed to
conceal me for the present; yet assuring
me at the same time, shaking her
head, that, when a woman was once
married, she must bear every thing.
Her pale face, on which appeared a
thousand haggard lines and delving
wrinkles, produced by what is emphatically
termed fretting, inforced
her remark; and I had afterwards an
opportunity of observing the treatment
she had to endure, which grizzled her
into patience. She toiled from morning
till night; yet her husband would rob
the till, and take away the money re<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-79" id="BPg_2-79"></a>[<a href="images/v2-79.png">79</a>]</span>served
for paying bills; and, returning
home drunk, he would beat her if she
chanced to offend him, though she had
a child at the breast.</p>

<p>"These scenes awoke me at night;
and, in the morning, I heard her, as
usual, talk to her dear Johnny&mdash;he,
forsooth, was her master; no slave in
the West Indies had one more despotic;
but fortunately she was of the
true Russian breed of wives.</p>

<p>"My mind, during the few past
days, seemed, as it were, disengaged
from my body; but, now the struggle
was over, I felt very forcibly the effect
which perturbation of spirits produces
on a woman in my situation.</p>

<p>"The apprehension of a miscarriage,
obliged me to confine myself to
my apartment near a fortnight; but
I wrote to my uncle's friend for money,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-80" id="BPg_2-80"></a>[<a href="images/v2-80.png">80</a>]</span>
promising 'to call on him, and explain
my situation, when I was well enough
to go out; mean time I earnestly intreated
him, not to mention my place of
abode to any one, lest my husband&mdash;such
the law considered him&mdash;should
disturb the mind he could not conquer.
I mentioned my intention of setting out
for Lisbon, to claim my uncle's protection,
the moment my health would
permit.'</p>

<p>"The tranquillity however, which
I was recovering, was soon interrupted.
My landlady came up to me one
day, with eyes swollen with weeping,
unable to utter what she was commanded
to say. She declared, 'That
she was never so miserable in her life;
that she must appear an ungrateful
monster; and that she would readily
go down on her knees to me, to intreat<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-81" id="BPg_2-81"></a>[<a href="images/v2-81.png">81</a>]</span>
me to forgive her, as she had done to
her husband to spare her the cruel
task.' Sobs prevented her from proceeding,
or answering my impatient
enquiries, to know what she meant.</p>

<p>"When she became a little more
composed, she took a newspaper out of
her pocket, declaring, 'that her heart
smote her, but what could she do?&mdash;she
must obey her husband.' I snatched
the paper from her. An advertisement
quickly met my eye, purporting,
that 'Maria Venables had, without
any assignable cause, absconded from
her husband; and any person harbouring
her, was menaced with the utmost
severity of the law.'</p>

<p>"Perfectly acquainted with Mr.
Venables' meanness of soul, this step
did not excite my surprise, and scarcely
my contempt. Resentment in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-82" id="BPg_2-82"></a>[<a href="images/v2-82.png">82</a>]</span>
breast, never survived love. I bade
the poor woman, in a kind tone, wipe
her eyes, and request her husband to
come up, and speak to me himself.</p>

<p>"My manner awed him. He respected
a lady, though not a woman;
and began to mutter out an apology.</p>

<p>"'Mr. Venables was a rich gentleman;
he wished to oblige me, but he
had suffered enough by the law already,
to tremble at the thought;
besides, for certain, we should come
together again, and then even I should
not thank him for being accessary to
keeping us asunder.&mdash;A husband and
wife were, God knows, just as one,&mdash;and
all would come round at last.' He
uttered a drawling 'Hem!' and then
with an arch look, added&mdash;'Master
might have had his little frolics&mdash;but<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-83" id="BPg_2-83"></a>[<a href="images/v2-83.png">83</a>]</span>&mdash;Lord
bless your heart!&mdash;men would
be men while the world stands.'</p>

<p>"To argue with this privileged first-born
of reason, I perceived, would be
vain. I therefore only requested him to
let me remain another day at his house,
while I sought for a lodging; and not
to inform Mr. Venables that I had ever
been sheltered there.</p>

<p>"He consented, because he had not
the courage to refuse a person for whom
he had an habitual respect; but I heard
the pent-up choler burst forth in curses,
when he met his wife, who was waiting
impatiently at the foot of the stairs,
to know what effect my expostulations
would have on him.</p>

<p>"Without wasting any time in the
fruitless indulgence of vexation, I once
more set out in search of an abode in<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-84" id="BPg_2-84"></a>[<a href="images/v2-84.png">84</a>]</span>
which I could hide myself for a few
weeks.</p>

<p>"Agreeing to pay an exorbitant
price, I hired an apartment, without
any reference being required relative
to my character: indeed, a glance
at my shape seemed to say, that my
motive for concealment was sufficiently
obvious. Thus was I obliged to shroud
my head in infamy.</p>

<p>"To avoid all danger of detection&mdash;I
use the appropriate word, my child,
for I was hunted out like a felon&mdash;I
determined to take possession of my
new lodgings that very evening.</p>

<p>"I did not inform my landlady
where I was going. I knew that she
had a sincere affection for me, and
would willingly have run any risk to
show her gratitude; yet I was fully convinced,
that a few kind words from<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-85" id="BPg_2-85"></a>[<a href="images/v2-85.png">85</a>]</span>
Johnny would have found the woman
in her, and her dear benefactress, as
she termed me in an agony of tears,
would have been sacrificed, to recompense
her tyrant for condescending to
treat her like an equal. He could be
kind-hearted, as she expressed it, when
he pleased. And this thawed sternness,
contrasted with his habitual brutality,
was the more acceptable, and
could not be purchased at too dear a
rate.</p>

<p>"The sight of the advertisement
made me desirous of taking refuge with
my uncle, let what would be the consequence;
and I repaired in a hackney
coach (afraid of meeting some person
who might chance to know me, had I
walked) to the chambers of my uncle's
friend.</p>

<p>"He received me with great polite<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-86" id="BPg_2-86"></a>[<a href="images/v2-86.png">86</a>]</span>ness
(my uncle had already prepossessed
him in my favour), and listened, with
interest, to my explanation of the
motives which had induced me to fly
from home, and skulk in obscurity,
with all the timidity of fear that ought
only to be the companion of guilt. He
lamented, with rather more gallantry
than, in my situation, I thought delicate,
that such a woman should be
thrown away on a man insensible to the
charms of beauty or grace. He seemed
at a loss what to advise me to do, to
evade my husband's search, without
hastening to my uncle, whom, he hesitating
said, I might not find alive. He
uttered this intelligence with visible
regret; requested me, at least, to wait
for the arrival of the next packet; offered
me what money I wanted, and
promised to visit me.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-87" id="BPg_2-87"></a>[<a href="images/v2-87.png">87</a>]</span>
"He kept his word; still no letter
arrived to put an end to my painful
state of suspense. I procured some
books and music, to beguile the tedious
solitary days.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Come, ever smiling Liberty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'And with thee bring thy jocund train:'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I sung&mdash;and sung till, saddened by the
strain of joy, I bitterly lamented the
fate that deprived me of all social pleasure.
Comparative liberty indeed I
had possessed myself of; but the jocund
train lagged far behind!</p>

<h2><a name="BCHAP_XIII" id="BCHAP_XIII"></a>CHAP. XIII.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">By</span> watching my only visitor, my
uncle's friend, or by some other means,
Mr. Venables discovered my residence,
and came to enquire for me. The
maid-servant assured him there was no
such person in the house. A bustle
ensued&mdash;I caught the alarm&mdash;listened&mdash;distinguished
his voice, and immediately
locked the door. They suddenly
grew still; and I waited near a
quarter of an hour, before I heard him
open the parlour door, and mount the
stairs with the mistress of the house,
who obsequiously declared that she
knew nothing of me.</p>

<p>"Finding my door locked, she requested
me to 'open it, and prepare to<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-89" id="BPg_2-89"></a>[<a href="images/v2-89.png">89</a>]</span>
go home with my husband, poor gentleman!
to whom I had already occasioned
sufficient vexation.' I made no
reply. Mr. Venables then, in an assumed
tone of softness, intreated me,
'to consider what he suffered, and my
own reputation, and get the better of
childish resentment.' He ran on in
the same strain, pretending to address
me, but evidently adapting his discourse
to the capacity of the landlady;
who, at every pause, uttered an exclamation
of pity; or 'Yes, to be sure&mdash;Very
true, sir.'</p>

<p>"Sick of the farce, and perceiving
that I could not avoid the hated interview,
I opened the door, and he entered.
Advancing with easy assurance
to take my hand, I shrunk from his
touch, with an involuntary start, as I
should have done from a noisome reptile,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-90" id="BPg_2-90"></a>[<a href="images/v2-90.png">90</a>]</span>
with more disgust than terror. His
conductress was retiring, to give us, as
she said, an opportunity to accommodate
matters. But I bade her come in,
or I would go out; and curiosity impelled
her to obey me.</p>

<p>"Mr. Venables began to expostulate;
and this woman, proud of his
confidence, to second him. But I
calmly silenced her, in the midst of a
vulgar harangue, and turning to him,
asked, 'Why he vainly tormented me?
declaring that no power on earth
should force me back to his house.'</p>

<p>"After a long altercation, the particulars
of which, it would be to no
purpose to repeat, he left the room.
Some time was spent in loud conversation
in the parlour below, and I
discovered that he had brought his
friend, an attorney, with him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-91" id="BPg_2-91"></a>[<a href="images/v2-91.png">91</a>]</span></p>
<p class="sp">* * * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>*&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; *&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; The tumult on the landing
place, brought out a gentleman, who
had recently taken apartments in the
house; he enquired why I was thus
assailed<a name="BFNanchor_91-A_7" id="BFNanchor_91-A_7"></a><a href="#BFootnote_91-A_7" class="fnanchor">[91-A]</a>? The voluble attorney instantly
repeated the trite tale. The
stranger turned to me, observing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-92" id="BPg_2-92"></a>[<a href="images/v2-92.png">92</a>]</span>
with the most soothing politeness and
manly interest, that 'my countenance
told a very different story.' He added,
'that I should not be insulted, or
forced out of the house, by any body.'</p>

<p>"'Not by her husband?' asked the
attorney.</p>

<p>"'No, sir, not by her husband.' Mr.
Venables advanced towards him&mdash;But
there was a decision in his attitude,
that so well seconded that of his voice,</p>
<p class="sp">* * * * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p class="sp">* * * * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>*&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; *&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; They left the house: at
the same time protesting, that any one
that should dare to protect me, should
be prosecuted with the utmost rigour.</p>

<p>"They were scarcely out of the
house, when my landlady came up to
me again, and begged my pardon, in
a very different tone. For, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-93" id="BPg_2-93"></a>[<a href="images/v2-93.png">93</a>]</span>
Mr. Venables had bid her, at her peril,
harbour me, he had not attended, I
found, to her broad hints, to discharge
the lodging. I instantly promised to
pay her, and make her a present to
compensate for my abrupt departure,
if she would procure me another lodging,
at a sufficient distance; and she, in
return, repeating Mr. Venables' plausible
tale, I raised her indignation, and
excited her sympathy, by telling her
briefly the truth.</p>

<p>"She expressed her commiseration
with such honest warmth, that I felt
soothed; for I have none of that fastidious
sensitiveness, which a vulgar accent
or gesture can alarm to the disregard
of real kindness. I was ever glad
to perceive in others the humane feelings
I delighted to exercise; and the
recollection of some ridiculous charac<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-94" id="BPg_2-94"></a>[<a href="images/v2-94.png">94</a>]</span>teristic
circumstances, which have occurred
in a moment of emotion, has
convulsed me with laughter, though
at the instant I should have thought it
sacrilegious to have smiled. Your improvement,
my dearest girl, being ever
present to me while I write, I note
these feelings, because women, more
accustomed to observe manners than
actions, are too much alive to ridicule.
So much so, that their boasted sensibility
is often stifled by false delicacy.
True sensibility, the sensibility which
is the auxiliary of virtue, and the soul
of genius, is in society so occupied
with the feelings of others, as scarcely
to regard its own sensations. With
what reverence have I looked up at my
uncle, the dear parent of my mind!
when I have seen the sense of his own
sufferings, of mind and body, absorbed<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-95" id="BPg_2-95"></a>[<a href="images/v2-95.png">95</a>]</span>
in a desire to comfort those, whose misfortunes
were comparatively trivial.
He would have been ashamed of being
as indulgent to himself, as he was to
others. 'Genuine fortitude,' he would
assert, 'consisted in governing our own
emotions, and making allowance for
the weaknesses in our friends, that we
would not tolerate in ourselves.' But
where is my fond regret leading me!</p>

<p>"'Women must be submissive,' said
my landlady. 'Indeed what could
most women do? Who had they to
maintain them, but their husbands?
Every woman, and especially a lady,
could not go through rough and
smooth, as she had done, to earn a little
bread.'</p>

<p>"She was in a talking mood, and
proceeded to inform me how she had
been used in the world. 'She knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-96" id="BPg_2-96"></a>[<a href="images/v2-96.png">96</a>]</span>
what it was to have a bad husband, or
she did not know who should.' I perceived
that she would be very much
mortified, were I not to attend to her
tale, and I did not attempt to interrupt
her, though I wished her, as soon
as possible, to go out in search of a new
abode for me, where I could once more
hide my head.</p>

<p>"She began by telling me, 'That
she had saved a little money in service;
and was over-persuaded (we must all
be in love once in our lives) to marry a
likely man, a footman in the family,
not worth a groat. My plan,' she continued,
'was to take a house, and let
out lodgings; and all went on well,
till my husband got acquainted with
an impudent slut, who chose to live on
other people's means&mdash;and then all
went to rack and ruin. He ran in<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-97" id="BPg_2-97"></a>[<a href="images/v2-97.png">97</a>]</span>
debt to buy her fine clothes, such
clothes as I never thought of wearing
myself, and&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;he
signed an execution on my very
goods, bought with the money I
worked so hard to get; and they came
and took my bed from under me, before
I heard a word of the matter.
Aye, madam, these are misfortunes
that you gentlefolks know nothing of,&mdash;but
sorrow is sorrow, let it come
which way it will.</p>

<p>"'I sought for a service again&mdash;very
hard, after having a house of my own!&mdash;but
he used to follow me, and kick up
such a riot when he was drunk, that I
could not keep a place; nay, he even
stole my clothes, and pawned them;
and when I went to the pawnbroker's,
and offered to take my oath that they
were not bought with a farthing of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-98" id="BPg_2-98"></a>[<a href="images/v2-98.png">98</a>]</span>
money, they said, 'It was all as one,
my husband had a right to whatever I
had.'</p>

<p>"'At last he listed for a soldier, and
I took a house, making an agreement
to pay for the furniture by degrees;
and I almost starved myself, till I once
more got before-hand in the world.</p>

<p>"'After an absence of six years
(God forgive me! I thought he was
dead) my husband returned; found me
out, and came with such a penitent
face, I forgave him, and clothed him
from head to foot. But he had not
been a week in the house, before some
of his creditors arrested him; and, he
selling my goods, I found myself once
more reduced to beggary; for I was
not as well able to work, go to bed
late, and rise early, as when I quitted
service; and then I thought it hard<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-99" id="BPg_2-99"></a>[<a href="images/v2-99.png">99</a>]</span>
enough. He was soon tired of me,
when there was nothing more to be
had, and left me again.</p>

<p>"<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">'</ins>I will not tell you how I was buffeted
about, till, hearing for certain
that he had died in an hospital abroad,
I once more returned to my old occupation;
but have not yet been able to
get my head above water: so, madam,
you must not be angry if I am afraid to
run any risk, when I know so well,
that women have always the worst of
it, when law is to decide.'</p>

<p>"After uttering a few more complaints,
I prevailed on my landlady to
go out in quest of a lodging; and, to
be more secure, I condescended to the
mean shift of changing my name.</p>

<p>"But why should I dwell on similar
incidents!&mdash;I was hunted, like an infected
beast, from three different apartments,
and should not have been al<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-100" id="BPg_2-100"></a>[<a href="images/v2-100.png">100</a>]</span>lowed
to rest in any, had not Mr. Venables,
informed of my uncle's dangerous
state of health, been inspired with
the fear of hurrying me out of the
world as I advanced in my pregnancy,
by thus tormenting and obliging me to
take sudden journeys to avoid him; and
then his speculations on my uncle's fortune
must prove abortive.</p>

<p>"One day, when he had pursued me
to an inn, I fainted, hurrying from him;
and, falling down, the sight of my blood
alarmed him, and obtained a respite for
me. It is strange that he should have
retained any hope, after observing my
unwavering determination; but, from
the mildness of my behaviour, when I
found all my endeavours to change his
disposition unavailing, he formed an
erroneous opinion of my character, imagining
that, were we once more together,
I should part with the money he<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-101" id="BPg_2-101"></a>[<a href="images/v2-101.png">101</a>]</span>
could not legally force from me, with
the same facility as formerly. My forbearance
and occasional sympathy he
had mistaken for weakness of character;
and, because he perceived that I
disliked resistance, he thought my indulgence
and compassion mere selfishness,
and never discovered that the fear of
being unjust, or of unnecessarily wounding
the feelings of another, was much
more painful to me, than any thing I
could have to endure myself. Perhaps
it was pride which made me imagine,
that I could bear what I dreaded to inflict;
and that it was often easier to suffer,
than to see the sufferings of others.</p>

<p>"I forgot to mention that, during
this persecution, I received a letter
from my uncle, informing me, 'that
he only found relief from continual
change of air; and that he intended to<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-102" id="BPg_2-102"></a>[<a href="images/v2-102.png">102</a>]</span>
return when the spring was a little more
advanced (it was now the middle of
February), and then we would plan a
journey to Italy, leaving the fogs and
cares of England far behind.' He approved
of my conduct, promised to
adopt my child, and seemed to have
no doubt of obliging Mr. Venables to
hear reason. He wrote to his friend,
by the same post, desiring him to call
on Mr. Venables in his name; and, in
consequence of the remonstrances he
dictated, I was permitted to lie-in tranquilly.</p>

<p>"The two or three weeks previous, I
had been allowed to rest in peace; but,
so accustomed was I to pursuit and
alarm, that I seldom closed my eyes
without being haunted by Mr. Venables'
image, who seemed to assume terrific or
hateful forms to torment me, wherever<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-103" id="BPg_2-103"></a>[<a href="images/v2-103.png">103</a>]</span>
I turned.&mdash;Sometimes a wild cat, a
roaring bull, or hideous assassin, whom
I vainly attempted to fly; at others he
was a demon, hurrying me to the brink
of a precipice, plunging me into dark
waves, or horrid gulfs; and I woke,
in violent fits of trembling anxiety, to
assure myself that it was all a dream,
and to endeavour to lure my waking
thoughts to wander to the delightful
Italian vales, I hoped soon to visit; or
to picture some august ruins, where I
reclined in fancy on a mouldering column,
and escaped, in the contemplation
of the heart-enlarging virtues of antiquity,
from the turmoil of cares that
had depressed all the daring purposes
of my soul. But I was not long allowed
to calm my mind by the exercise
of my imagination; for the third
day after your birth, my child, I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-104" id="BPg_2-104"></a>[<a href="images/v2-104.png">104</a>]</span>
surprised by a visit from my elder brother;
who came in the most abrupt
manner, to inform me of the death of
my uncle. He had left the greater
part of his fortune to my child, appointing
me its guardian; in short,
every step was taken to enable me to
be mistress of his fortune, without putting
any part of it in Mr. Venables'
power. My brother came to vent his
rage on me, for having, as he expressed
himself, 'deprived him, my uncle's
eldest nephew, of his inheritance;'
though my uncle's property, the fruit
of his own exertion, being all in the
funds, or on landed securities, there
was not a shadow of justice in the
charge.</p>

<p>"As I sincerely loved my uncle, this
intelligence brought on a fever, which
I struggled to conquer with all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-105" id="BPg_2-105"></a>[<a href="images/v2-105.png">105</a>]</span>
energy of my mind; for, in my desolate
state, I had it very much at heart to
suckle you, my poor babe. You
seemed my only tie to life, a cherub,
to whom I wished to be a father, as
well as a mother; and the double duty
appeared to me to produce a proportionate
increase of affection. But the
pleasure I felt, while sustaining you,
snatched from the wreck of hope, was
cruelly damped by melancholy reflections
on my widowed state&mdash;widowed
by the death of my uncle. Of Mr.
Venables I thought not, even when I
thought of the felicity of loving your
father, and how a mother's pleasure
might be exalted, and her care softened
by a husband's tenderness.&mdash;'Ought to
be!' I exclaimed; and I endeavoured
to drive away the tenderness that suffo<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-106" id="BPg_2-106"></a>[<a href="images/v2-106.png">106</a>]</span>cated
me; but my spirits were weak,
and the unbidden tears would flow.
'Why was I,' I would ask thee, but
thou didst not heed me,&mdash;'cut off from
the participation of the sweetest pleasure
of life?' I imagined with what
extacy, after the pains of child-bed, I
should have presented my little stranger,
whom I had so long wished to view, to
a respectable father, and with what
maternal fondness I should have pressed
them both to my heart!&mdash;Now I kissed
her with less delight, though with the
most endearing compassion, poor helpless
one! when I perceived a slight resemblance
of him, to whom she owed
her existence; or, if any gesture reminded
me of him, even in his best
days, my heart heaved, and I pressed
the innocent to my bosom, as if to<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-107" id="BPg_2-107"></a>[<a href="images/v2-107.png">107</a>]</span>
purify it&mdash;yes, I blushed to think that
its purity had been sullied, by allowing
such a man to be its father.</p>

<p>"After my recovery, I began to
think of taking a house in the country,
or of making an excursion on the continent,
to avoid Mr. Venables; and to
open my heart to new pleasures and
affection. The spring was melting into
summer, and you, my little companion,
began to smile&mdash;that smile
made hope bud out afresh, assuring me
the world was not a desert. Your
gestures were ever present to my
fancy; and I dwelt on the joy I should
feel when you would begin to walk and
lisp. Watching your wakening mind,
and shielding from every rude blast
my tender blossom, I recovered my
spirits&mdash;I dreamed not of the frost<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-108" id="BPg_2-108"></a>[<a href="images/v2-108.png">108</a>]</span>&mdash;'the
killing frost,' to which you were
destined to be exposed.&mdash;But I lose all
patience&mdash;and execrate the injustice
of the world&mdash;folly! ignorance!&mdash;I
should rather call it; but, shut up from
a free circulation of thought, and always
pondering on the same griefs, I
writhe under the torturing apprehensions,
which ought to excite only
honest indignation, or active compassion;
and would, could I view them
as the natural consequence of things.
But, born a woman&mdash;and born to suffer,
in endeavouring to repress my own
emotions, I feel more acutely the various
ills my sex are fated to bear&mdash;I
feel that the evils they are subject to
endure, degrade them so far below
their oppressors, as almost to justify
their tyranny; leading at the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-109" id="BPg_2-109"></a>[<a href="images/v2-109.png">109</a>]</span>

weakness the cause, which is only
the consequence of short-sighted despotism.</p>

Darnford is the stranger intended in this place.

<h2><a name="BCHAP_XIV" id="BCHAP_XIV"></a>CHAP. XIV.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">As</span> my mind grew calmer, the
visions of Italy again returned with
their former glow of colouring; and I
resolved on quitting the kingdom for
a time, in search of the cheerfulness,
that naturally results from a change of
scene, unless we carry the barbed arrow
with us, and only see what we
feel.</p>

<p>"During the period necessary to
prepare for a long absence, I sent a
supply to pay my father's debts, and
settled my brothers in eligible situations;
but my attention was not
wholly engrossed by my family, though
I do not think it necessary to enumerate
the common exertions of huma<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-111" id="BPg_2-111"></a>[<a href="images/v2-111.png">111</a>]</span>nity.
The manner in which my uncle's
property was settled, prevented
me from making the addition to the
fortune of my surviving sister, that I
could have wished; but I had prevailed
on him to bequeath her two
thousand pounds, and she determined
to marry a lover, to whom she had
been some time attached. Had it not
been for this engagement, I should have
invited her to accompany me in my
tour; and I might have escaped the
pit, so artfully dug in my path, when
I was the least aware of danger.</p>

<p>"I had thought of remaining in
England, till I weaned my child; but
this state of freedom was too peaceful
to last, and I had soon reason to wish
to hasten my departure. A friend of
Mr. Venables, the same attorney who
had accompanied him in several excur<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-112" id="BPg_2-112"></a>[<a href="images/v2-112.png">112</a>]</span>sions
to hunt me from my hiding places,
waited on me to propose a reconciliation.
On my refusal, he indirectly
advised me to make over to my husband&mdash;for
husband he would term
him&mdash;the greater part of the property
I had at command, menacing me with
continual persecution unless I complied,
and that, as a last resort, he
would claim the child. I did not,
though intimidated by the last insinuation,
scruple to declare, that I would
not allow him to squander the money
left to me for far different purposes,
but offered him five hundred pounds, if
he would sign a bond not to torment
me any more. My maternal anxiety
made me thus appear to waver from
my first determination, and probably
suggested to him, or his diabolical<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-113" id="BPg_2-113"></a>[<a href="images/v2-113.png">113</a>]</span>
agent, the infernal plot, which has
succeeded but too well.</p>

<p>"The bond was executed; still I
was impatient to leave England. Mischief
hung in the air when we breathed
the same; I wanted seas to divide
us, and waters to roll between, till he
had forgotten that I had the means of
helping him through a new scheme.
Disturbed by the late occurrences, I instantly
prepared for my departure.
My only delay was waiting for a maid-servant,
who spoke French fluently,
and had been warmly recommended to
me. A valet I was advised to hire,
when I fixed on my place of residence
for any time.</p>

<p>"My God, with what a light heart
did I set out for Dover!&mdash;It was not my
country, but my cares, that I was leaving
behind. My heart seemed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-114" id="BPg_2-114"></a>[<a href="images/v2-114.png">114</a>]</span>
bound with the wheels, or rather appeared
the centre on which they twirled.
I clasped you to my bosom, exclaiming
'And you will be safe&mdash;quite
safe&mdash;when&mdash;we are once on
board the packet.&mdash;Would we were
there!' I smiled at my idle fears, as
the natural effect of continual alarm;
and I scarcely owned to myself that I
dreaded Mr. Venables's cunning, or
was conscious of the horrid delight he
would feel, at forming stratagem after
stratagem to circumvent me. I was
already in the snare&mdash;I never reached
the packet&mdash;I never saw thee more.&mdash;I
grow breathless. I have scarcely patience
to write down the details. The
maid&mdash;the plausible woman I had
hired&mdash;put, doubtless, some stupifying
potion in what I ate or drank, the
morning I left town. All I know is,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-115" id="BPg_2-115"></a>[<a href="images/v2-115.png">115</a>]</span>
that she must have quitted the chaise,
shameless wretch! and taken (from
my breast) my babe with her. How
could a creature in a female form see
me caress thee, and steal thee from my
arms! I must stop, stop to repress a
mother's anguish; left, in bitterness of
soul, I imprecate the wrath of heaven
on this tiger, who tore my only comfort
from me.</p>

<p>"How long I slept I know not;
certainly many hours, for I woke at the
close of day, in a strange confusion of
thought. I was probably roused to recollection
by some one thundering at a
huge, unwieldy gate. Attempting to
ask where I was, my voice died away,
and I tried to raise it in vain, as I have
done in a dream. I looked for my babe
with affright; feared that it had fallen
out of my lap, while I had so strange<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-116" id="BPg_2-116"></a>[<a href="images/v2-116.png">116</a>]</span>ly
forgotten her; and, such was the
vague intoxication, I can give it no
other name, in which I was plunged,
I could not recollect when or where I
last saw you; but I sighed, as if my
heart wanted room to clear my head.</p>

<p>"The gates opened heavily, and
the sullen sound of many locks
<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'and and'">and</ins> bolts drawn back, grated on
my very soul, before I was appalled by
the creeking of the dismal hinges, as
they closed after me. The gloomy
pile was before me, half in ruins; some
of the aged trees of the avenue were
cut down, and left to rot where they
fell; and as we approached some
mouldering steps, a monstrous dog
darted forwards to the length of his
chain, and barked and growled infernally.</p>

<p>"The door was opened slowly, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-117" id="BPg_2-117"></a>[<a href="images/v2-117.png">117</a>]</span>
a murderous visage peeped out, with a
lantern. 'Hush!' he uttered, in a
threatning tone, and the affrighted
animal stole back to his kennel. The
door of the chaise flew back, the
stranger put down the lantern, and
clasped his dreadful arms around me.
It was certainly the effect of the soporific
draught, for, instead of exerting
my strength, I sunk without motion,
though not without sense, on his shoulder,
my limbs refusing to obey my
will. I was carried up the steps into a
close-shut hall. A candle flaring in
the socket, scarcely dispersed the darkness,
though it displayed to me the
ferocious countenance of the wretch
who held me.</p>

<p>"He mounted a wide staircase.
Large figures painted on the walls
seemed to start on me, and glaring<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-118" id="BPg_2-118"></a>[<a href="images/v2-118.png">118</a>]</span>
eyes to meet me at every turn. Entering
a long gallery, a dismal shriek made
me spring out of my conductor's arms,
with I know not what mysterious emotion
of terror; but I fell on the floor,
unable to sustain myself.</p>

<p>"A strange-looking female started
out of one of the recesses, and observed
me with more curiosity than interest;
till, sternly bid retire, she flitted back
like a shadow. Other faces, strongly
marked, or distorted, peeped through
the half-opened doors, and I heard
some incoherent sounds. I had no
distinct idea where I could be&mdash;I looked
on all sides, and almost doubted whether
I was alive or dead.</p>

<p>"Thrown on a bed, I immediately
sunk into insensibility again; and next
day, gradually recovering the use of
reason, I began, starting affrighted<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-119" id="BPg_2-119"></a>[<a href="images/v2-119.png">119</a>]</span>
from the conviction, to discover where
I was confined&mdash;I insisted on seeing the
master of the mansion&mdash;I saw him&mdash;and
perceived that I was buried alive.&mdash;</p>

<p>"Such, my child, are the events of
thy mother's life to this dreadful moment&mdash;Should
she ever escape from
the fangs of her enemies, she will add
the secrets of her prison-house&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Some lines were here crossed out,
and the memoirs broke off abruptly
with the names of Jemima and Darnford.</p>

<h2><a name="BCHAP_XV" id="BCHAP_XV"></a>CHAP. XV.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Darnford</span> returned the memoirs
to Maria, with a most affectionate
letter, in which he reasoned on "the
absurdity of the laws respecting matrimony,
which, till divorces could be
more easily obtained, was," he declared,
"the most insufferable bondage. Ties of
this nature could not bind minds governed
by superior principles; and such
beings were privileged to act above the
dictates of laws they had no voice in
framing, if they had sufficient strength
of mind to endure the natural consequence.
In her case, to talk of duty,
was a farce, excepting what was due
to herself. Delicacy, as well as reason,
forbade her ever to think of returning<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-124" id="BPg_2-124"></a>[<a href="images/v2-124.png">124</a>]</span>
to her husband: was she then to restrain
her charming sensibility through
mere prejudice? These arguments
were not absolutely impartial, for he
disdained to conceal, that, when he
appealed to her reason, he felt that
he had some interest in her heart.&mdash;The
conviction was not more transporting,
than sacred&mdash;a thousand times a
day, he asked himself how he had merited
such happiness?&mdash;and as often he
determined to purify the heart she
deigned to inhabit&mdash;He intreated to be
again admitted to her presence."</p>

<p>He was; and the tear which glistened
in his eye, when he respectfully
pressed her to his bosom, rendered him
peculiarly dear to the unfortunate mother.
Grief had stilled the transports
of love, only to render their mutual
tenderness more touching. In former<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-125" id="BPg_2-125"></a>[<a href="images/v2-125.png">125</a>]</span>
interviews, Darnford had contrived, by
a hundred little pretexts, to sit near
her, to take her hand, or to meet her
eyes&mdash;now it was all soothing affection,
and esteem seemed to have rivalled
love. He adverted to her narrative,
and spoke with warmth of the oppression
she had endured.&mdash;His eyes, glowing
with a lambent flame, told her
how much he wished to restore her to
liberty and love; but he kissed her
hand, as if it had been that of a saint;
and spoke of the loss of her child, as if it
had been his own.&mdash;What could have
been more flattering to Maria?&mdash;Every
instance of self-denial was registered in
her heart, and she loved him, for loving
her too well to give way to the
transports of passion.</p>

<p>They met again and again; and
Darnford declared, while passion suf<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-126" id="BPg_2-126"></a>[<a href="images/v2-126.png">126</a>]</span>fused
his cheeks, that he never before
knew what it was to love.&mdash;</p>

<p>One morning Jemima informed
Maria, that her master intended to
wait on her, and speak to her without
witnesses. He came, and brought a
letter with him, pretending that he
was ignorant of its contents, though he
insisted on having it returned to him.
It was from the attorney already mentioned,
who informed her of the death
of her child, and hinted, "that she
could not now have a legitimate heir,
and that, would she make over the
half of her fortune during life, she
should be conveyed to Dover, and permitted
to pursue her plan of travelling."</p>

<p>Maria answered with warmth,
"That she had no terms to make with
the murderer of her babe, nor would<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-127" id="BPg_2-127"></a>[<a href="images/v2-127.png">127</a>]</span>
she purchase liberty at the price of her
own respect."</p>

<p>She began to expostulate with her
jailor; but he sternly bade her "Be
silent&mdash;he had not gone so far, not to
go further."</p>

<p>Darnford came in the evening.
Jemima was obliged to be absent, and
she, as usual, locked the door on them,
to prevent interruption or discovery.&mdash;The
lovers were, at first, embarrassed;
but fell insensibly into confidential discourse.
Darnford represented, "that
they might soon be parted," and wished
her "to put it out of the power of fate
to separate them."</p>

<p>As her husband she now received him,
and he solemnly pledged himself as her
protector&mdash;and eternal friend.&mdash;</p>

<p>There was one peculiarity in Maria's
mind: she was more anxious not
to deceive, than to guard against de<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-128" id="BPg_2-128"></a>[<a href="images/v2-128.png">128</a>]</span>ception;
and had rather trust without
sufficient reason, than be for ever the
prey of doubt. Besides, what are we,
when the mind has, from reflection, a
certain kind of elevation, which exalts
the contemplation above the little concerns
of prudence! We see what we
wish, and make a world of our own&mdash;and,
though reality may sometimes open
a door to misery, yet the moments of
happiness procured by the imagination,
may, without a paradox, be reckoned
among the solid comforts of life. Maria
now, imagining that she had found
a being of celestial mould&mdash;was happy,&mdash;nor
was she deceived.&mdash;He was then
plastic in her impassioned hand&mdash;and
reflected all the sentiments which animated
and warmed her.&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="BCHAP_XVI" id="BCHAP_XVI"></a>CHAP. XVI.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> morning confusion seemed to
reign in the house, and Jemima came
in terror, to inform Maria, "that her
master had left it, with a determination,
she was assured (and too many
circumstances corroborated the opinion,
to leave a doubt of its truth) of never
returning. I am prepared then,"
said Jemima, "to accompany you in
your flight."</p>

<p>Maria started up, her eyes darting
towards the door, as if afraid that some
one should fasten it on her for ever.</p>

<p>Jemima continued, "I have perhaps
no right now to expect the performance
of your promise; but on you<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-130" id="BPg_2-130"></a>[<a href="images/v2-130.png">130</a>]</span>
it depends to reconcile me with the
human race."</p>

<p>"But Darnford!"&mdash;exclaimed Maria,
mournfully&mdash;sitting down again,
and crossing her arms&mdash;"I have no
child to go to, and liberty has lost its
sweets."</p>

<p>"I am much mistaken, if Darnford
is not the cause of my master's flight&mdash;his
keepers assure me, that they have
promised to confine him two days
longer, and then he will be free&mdash;you
cannot see him; but they will give a
letter to him the moment he is free.&mdash;In
that inform him where he may find
you in London; fix on some hotel.
Give me your clothes; I will send them
out of the house with mine, and we
will slip out at the garden-gate. Write
your letter while I make these arrangements,
but lose no time!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-131" id="BPg_2-131"></a>[<a href="images/v2-131.png">131</a>]</span>
In an agitation of spirit, not to be
calmed, Maria began to write to Darnford.
She called him by the sacred
name of "husband," and bade him "hasten
to her, to share her fortune, or she
would return to him."&mdash;An hotel in the
Adelphi was the place of rendezvous.</p>

<p>The letter was sealed and given in
charge; and with light footsteps, yet
terrified at the sound of them, she descended,
scarcely breathing, and with
an indistinct fear that she should never
get out at the garden gate. Jemima
went first.</p>

<p>A being, with a visage that would
have suited one possessed by a devil,
crossed the path, and seized Maria by
the arm. Maria had no fear but of being
detained&mdash;"Who are you? what
are you?" for the form was scarcely human.
"If you are made of flesh and<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-132" id="BPg_2-132"></a>[<a href="images/v2-132.png">132</a>]</span>
blood," his ghastly eyes glared on her,
"do not stop me!"</p>

<p>"Woman," interrupted a sepulchral
voice, "what have I to do with thee?"&mdash;Still
he grasped her hand, muttering
a curse.</p>

<p>"No, no; you have nothing to do
with me," she exclaimed, "this is a
moment of life and death!"&mdash;</p>

<p>With supernatural force she broke
from him, and, throwing her arms
round Jemima, cried, "Save me!" The
being, from whose grasp she had loosed
herself, took up a stone as they opened
the door, and with a kind of hellish
sport threw it after them. They were
out of his reach.</p>

<p>When Maria arrived in town, she
drove to the hotel already fixed on. But
she could not sit still&mdash;her child was ever
before her; and all that had passed dur<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-133" id="BPg_2-133"></a>[<a href="images/v2-133.png">133</a>]</span>ing
her confinement, appeared to be a
dream. She went to the house in the
suburbs, where, as she now discovered,
her babe had been sent. The moment
she entered, her heart grew sick; but
she wondered not that it had proved its
grave. She made the necessary enquiries,
and the church-yard was pointed
out, in which it rested under a turf. A
little frock which the nurse's child
wore (Maria had made it herself)
caught her eye. The nurse was glad
to sell it for half-a-guinea, and Maria
hastened away with the relic, and, re-entering
the hackney-coach which
waited for her, gazed on it, till she
reached her hotel.</p>

<p>She then waited on the attorney
who had made her uncle's will, and explained
to him her situation. He readily
advanced her some of the money<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-134" id="BPg_2-134"></a>[<a href="images/v2-134.png">134</a>]</span>
which still remained in his hands, and
promised to take the whole of the case
into consideration. Maria only wished
to be permitted to remain in quiet&mdash;She
found that several bills, apparently
with her signature, had been presented
to her agent, nor was she for a moment
at a loss to guess by whom they had
been forged; yet, equally averse to
threaten or intreat, she requested her
friend [the solicitor] to call on Mr. Venables.
He was not to be found at
home; but at length his agent, the attorney,
offered a conditional promise to
Maria, to leave her in peace, as long as
she behaved with propriety, if she
would give up the notes. Maria inconsiderately
consented&mdash;Darnford was
arrived, and she wished to be only alive
to love; she wished to forget the anguish
she felt whenever she thought of
her child.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-135" id="BPg_2-135"></a>[<a href="images/v2-135.png">135</a>]</span>
They took a ready furnished lodging
together, for she was above disguise;
Jemima insisting on being considered
as her house-keeper, and to receive
the customary stipend. On no
other terms would she remain with her
friend.</p>

<p>Darnford was indefatigable in tracing
the mysterious circumstances of
his confinement. The cause was simply,
that a relation, a very distant one,
to whom he was heir, had died intestate,
leaving a considerable fortune.
On the news of Darnford's arrival [in
England, a person, intrusted with the
management of the property, and who
had the writings in his possession, determining,
by one bold stroke, to strip
Darnford of the succession,] had planned
his confinement; and [as soon
as he had taken the measures he<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-136" id="BPg_2-136"></a>[<a href="images/v2-136.png">136</a>]</span>
judged most conducive to his object,
this ruffian, together with his instrument,]
the keeper of the private mad-house,
left the kingdom. Darnford,
who still pursued his enquiries, at last
discovered that they had fixed their
place of refuge at Paris.</p>

<p>Maria and he determined therefore,
with the faithful Jemima, to visit
that metropolis, and accordingly were
preparing for the journey, when they
were informed that Mr. Venables had
commenced an action against Darnford
for seduction and adultery. The indignation
Maria felt cannot be explained;
she repented of the forbearance she had
exercised in giving up the notes. Darnford
could not put off his journey, without
risking the loss of his property:
Maria therefore furnished him with money
for his expedition; and determined<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-137" id="BPg_2-137"></a>[<a href="images/v2-137.png">137</a>]</span>
to remain in London till the termination
of this affair.</p>

<p>She visited some ladies with whom
she had formerly been intimate, but
was refused admittance; and at the
opera, or Ranelagh, they could not recollect
her. Among these ladies there
were some, not her most intimate acquaintance,
who were generally supposed
to avail themselves of the cloke
of marriage, to conceal a mode of conduct,
that would for ever have damned
their fame, had they been innocent, seduced
girls. These particularly stood
aloof.&mdash;Had she remained with her husband,
practising insincerity, and neglecting
her child to manage an intrigue,
she would still have been visited
and respected. If, instead of
openly living with her lover, she could
have condescended to call into play a<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-138" id="BPg_2-138"></a>[<a href="images/v2-138.png">138</a>]</span>
thousand arts, which, degrading her
own mind, might have allowed the
people who were not deceived, to pretend
to be so, she would have been
caressed and treated like an honourable
woman. "And Brutus<a name="BFNanchor_138-A_8" id="BFNanchor_138-A_8"></a><a href="#BFootnote_138-A_8" class="fnanchor">[138-A]</a> is an honourable
man!" said Mark-Antony with
equal sincerity.</p>

<p>With Darnford she did not taste uninterrupted
felicity; there was a volatility
in his manner which often distressed
her; but love gladdened the
scene; besides, he was the most tender,
sympathizing creature in the world.
A fondness for the sex often gives an
appearance of humanity to the behaviour
of men, who have small pretensions
to the reality; and they seem to<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-139" id="BPg_2-139"></a>[<a href="images/v2-139.png">139</a>]</span>
love others, when they are only pursuing
their own gratification. Darnford
appeared ever willing to avail himself
of her taste and acquirements, while
she endeavoured to profit by his decision
of character, and to eradicate some
of the romantic notions, which had
taken root in her mind, while in adversity
she had brooded over visions of
unattainable bliss.</p>

<p>The real affections of life, when
they are allowed to burst forth, are buds
pregnant with joy and all the sweet
emotions of the soul; yet they branch
out with wild ease, unlike the artificial
forms of felicity, sketched by an imagination
painful alive. The substantial
happiness, which enlarges and civilizes
the mind, may be compared to
the pleasure experienced in roving
through nature at large, inhaling the<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-140" id="BPg_2-140"></a>[<a href="images/v2-140.png">140</a>]</span>
sweet gale natural to the clime; while
the reveries of a feverish imagination
continually sport themselves in gardens
full of aromatic shrubs, which cloy
while they delight, and weaken the
sense of pleasure they gratify. The heaven
of fancy, below or beyond the stars,
in this life, or in those ever-smiling regions
surrounded by the unmarked
ocean of futurity, have an insipid uniformity
which palls. Poets have imagined
scenes of bliss; but, fencing out
sorrow, all the extatic emotions of the
soul, and even its grandeur, seem to
be equally excluded. We dose over
the unruffled lake, and long to scale
the rocks which fence the happy valley
of contentment, though serpents hiss
in the pathless desert, and danger lurks
in the unexplored wiles. Maria found
herself more indulgent as she was hap<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-141" id="BPg_2-141"></a>[<a href="images/v2-141.png">141</a>]</span>pier,
and discovered virtues, in characters
she had before disregarded, while
chasing the phantoms of elegance and
excellence, which sported in the meteors
that exhale in the marshes of misfortune.
The heart is often shut by
romance against social pleasure; and,
fostering a sickly sensibility, grows callous
to the soft touches of humanity.</p>

<p>To part with Darnford was indeed
cruel.&mdash;It was to feel most painfully
alone; but she rejoiced to think, that
she should spare him the care and perplexity
of the suit, and meet him again,
all his own. Marriage, as at present
constituted, she considered as leading
to immorality&mdash;yet, as the odium of
society impedes usefulness, she wished to
avow her affection to Darnford, by becoming
his wife according to established
rules; not to be confounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-142" id="BPg_2-142"></a>[<a href="images/v2-142.png">142</a>]</span>
with women who act from very different
motives, though her conduct would
be just the same without the ceremony
as with it, and her expectations from
him not less firm. The being summoned
to defend herself from a charge which
she was determined to plead guilty to,
was still galling, as it roused bitter reflections
on the situation of women in
society.</p>

<h2><a name="BCHAP_XVII" id="BCHAP_XVII"></a>CHAP. XVII.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Such</span> was her state of mind when
the dogs of law were let loose on
her. Maria took the task of conducting
Darnford's defence upon herself.
She instructed his counsel to plead
guilty to the charge of adultery; but
to deny that of seduction.</p>

<p>The counsel for the plaintiff opened
the cause, by observing, "that his client
had ever been an indulgent husband,
and had borne with several defects
of temper, while he had nothing
criminal to lay to the charge of his
wife. But that she left his house without
assigning any cause. He could not
assert that she was then acquainted
with the defendant; yet, when he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-144" id="BPg_2-144"></a>[<a href="images/v2-144.png">144</a>]</span>
once endeavouring to bring her back
to her home, this man put the peace-officers
to flight, and took her he knew
not whither. After the birth of her child,
her conduct was so strange, and a melancholy
malady having afflicted one of
the family, which delicacy forbade the
dwelling on, it was necessary to confine
her. By some means the defendant
enabled her to make her escape,
and they had lived together, in despite
of all sense of order and decorum. The
adultery was allowed, it was not necessary
to bring any witnesses to prove it;
but the seduction, though highly probable
from the circumstances which
he had the honour to state, could not
be so clearly proved.&mdash;It was of the
most atrocious kind, as decency was set
at defiance, and respect for reputa<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-145" id="BPg_2-145"></a>[<a href="images/v2-145.png">145</a>]</span>tion,
which shows internal compunction,
utterly disregarded."</p>

<p>A strong sense of injustice had silenced
every emotion, which a mixture
of true and false delicacy might otherwise
have excited in Maria's bosom.
She only felt in earnest to insist on the
privilege of her nature. The sarcasms
of society, and the condemnation of a
mistaken world, were nothing to her,
compared with acting contrary to those
feelings which were the foundation of
her principles. [She therefore eagerly
put herself forward, instead of desiring
to be absent, on this memorable occasion.]</p>

<p>Convinced that the subterfuges of
the law were disgraceful, she wrote a
paper, which she expressly desired might
be read in court:</p>

<p>"Married when scarcely able to dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-146" id="BPg_2-146"></a>[<a href="images/v2-146.png">146</a>]</span>tinguish
the nature of the engagement,
I yet submitted to the rigid
laws which enslave women, and obeyed
the man whom I could no longer love.
Whether the duties of the state are
reciprocal, I mean not to discuss; but
I can prove repeated infidelities which
I overlooked or pardoned. Witnesses
are not wanting to establish these facts.
I at present maintain the child of a
maid servant, sworn to him, and born
after our marriage. I am ready to allow,
that education and circumstances
lead men to think and act with less delicacy,
than the preservation of order
in society demands from women; but
surely I may without assumption declare,
that, though I could excuse the
birth, I could not the desertion of this
unfortunate babe:&mdash;and, while I despised
the man, it was not easy to ve<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-147" id="BPg_2-147"></a>[<a href="images/v2-147.png">147</a>]</span>nerate
the husband. With proper restrictions
however, I revere the institution
which fraternizes the world. I exclaim
against the laws which throw the
whole weight of the yoke on the weaker
shoulders, and force women, when they
claim protectorship as mothers, to sign
a contract, which renders them dependent
on the caprice of the tyrant, whom
choice or necessity has appointed to
reign over them. Various are the cases,
in which a woman ought to separate
herself from her husband; and mine,
I may be allowed emphatically to insist,
comes under the description of the
most aggravated.</p>

<p>"I will not enlarge on those provocations
which only the individual can
estimate; but will bring forward such
charges only, the truth of which is an
insult upon humanity. In order to<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-148" id="BPg_2-148"></a>[<a href="images/v2-148.png">148</a>]</span>
promote certain destructive speculations,
Mr. Venables prevailed on me
to borrow certain sums of a wealthy relation;
and, when I refused further
compliance, he thought of bartering
my person; and not only allowed opportunities
to, but urged, a friend
from whom he borrowed money, to
seduce me. On the discovery of this
act of atrocity, I determined to leave
him, and in the most decided manner,
for ever. I consider all obligation as
made void by his conduct; and hold,
that schisms which proceed from want
of principles, can never be healed.</p>

<p>"He received a fortune with me to
the amount of five thousand pounds. On
the death of my uncle, convinced that
I could provide for my child, I destroyed
the settlement of that fortune.
I required none of my property to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-149" id="BPg_2-149"></a>[<a href="images/v2-149.png">149</a>]</span>
returned to me, nor shall enumerate the
sums extorted from me during six years
that we lived together.</p>

<p>"After leaving, what the law considers
as my home, I was hunted like a criminal
from place to place, though I
contracted no debts, and demanded no
maintenance&mdash;yet, as the laws sanction
such proceeding, and make women the
property of their husbands, I forbear
to animadvert. After the birth of my
daughter, and the death of my uncle,
who left a very considerable property
to myself and child, I was exposed to
new persecution; and, because I had,
before arriving at what is termed years
of discretion, pledged my faith, I was
treated by the world, as bound for ever
to a man whose vices were notorious.
Yet what are the vices generally
known, to the various miseries that a<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-150" id="BPg_2-150"></a>[<a href="images/v2-150.png">150</a>]</span>
woman may be subject to, which,
though deeply felt, eating into the
soul, elude description, and may be
glossed over! A false morality is even
established, which makes all the virtue
of women consist in chastity, submission,
and the forgiveness of injuries.</p>

<p>"I pardon my oppressor&mdash;bitterly as I
lament the loss of my child, torn from
me in the most violent manner. But
nature revolts, and my soul sickens at
the bare supposition, that it could ever
be a duty to pretend affection, when a
separation is necessary to prevent my
feeling hourly aversion.</p>

<p>"To force me to give my fortune, I
was imprisoned&mdash;yes; in a private mad-house.&mdash;There,
in the heart of misery,
I met the man charged with seducing
me. We became attached&mdash;I deemed,
and ever shall deem, myself free. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-151" id="BPg_2-151"></a>[<a href="images/v2-151.png">151</a>]</span>
death of my babe dissolved the only tie
which subsisted between me and my,
what is termed, lawful husband.</p>

<p>"To this person, thus encountered,
I voluntarily gave myself, never considering
myself as any more bound to
transgress the laws of moral purity,
because the will of my husband
might be pleaded in my excuse, than
to transgress those laws to which
[the policy of artificial society has]
annexed [positive] punishments.&mdash;&mdash;While
no command of a husband can
prevent a woman from suffering for
certain crimes, she must be allowed
to consult her conscience, and regulate
her conduct, in some degree, by her
own sense of right. The respect I owe
to myself, demanded my strict adherence
to my determination of never
viewing Mr. Venables in the light of a
husband, nor could it forbid me from<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-152" id="BPg_2-152"></a>[<a href="images/v2-152.png">152</a>]</span>
encouraging another. If I am unfortunately
united to an unprincipled man,
am I for ever to be shut out from fulfilling
the duties of a wife and mother?&mdash;I
wish my country to approve of my
conduct; but, if laws exist, made by
the strong to oppress the weak, I appeal
to my own sense of justice, and
declare that I will not live with the
individual, who has violated every moral
obligation which binds man to man.</p>

<p>"I protest equally against any charge
being brought to criminate the man,
whom I consider as my husband. I
was six-and-twenty when I left Mr.
Venables' roof; if ever I am to be supposed
to arrive at an age to direct my
own actions, I must by that time have
arrived at it.&mdash;I acted with deliberation.&mdash;Mr.
Darnford found me a forlorn
and oppressed woman, and promised<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-153" id="BPg_2-153"></a>[<a href="images/v2-153.png">153</a>]</span>
the protection women in the present
state of society want.&mdash;But the man
who now claims me&mdash;was he deprived
of my society by this conduct? The
question is an insult to common sense,
considering where Mr. Darnford met
me.&mdash;Mr. Venables' door was indeed
open to me&mdash;nay, threats and intreaties
were used to induce me to return; but
why? Was affection or honour the
motive?&mdash;I cannot, it is true, dive into
the recesses of the human heart&mdash;yet
I presume to assert, [borne out as
I am by a variety of circumstances,]
that he was merely influenced by the
most rapacious avarice.</p>

<p>"I claim then a divorce, and the
liberty of enjoying, free from molestation,
the fortune left to me by a relation,
who was well aware of the character
of the man with whom I had to<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-154" id="BPg_2-154"></a>[<a href="images/v2-154.png">154</a>]</span>
contend.&mdash;I appeal to the justice and
humanity of the jury&mdash;a body of men,
whose private judgment must be allowed
to modify laws, that must be
unjust, because definite rules can never
apply to indefinite circumstances&mdash;and
I deprecate punishment upon the man
of my choice, freeing him, as I solemnly
do, from the charge of seduction.]</p>

<p>"I did not put myself into a situation
to justify a charge of adultery, till
I had, from conviction, shaken off the
fetters which bound me to Mr. Venables.&mdash;While
I lived with him, I defy
the voice of calumny to sully what is
termed the fair fame of woman.&mdash;Neglected
by my husband, I never encouraged
a lover; and preserved with
scrupulous care, what is termed my
honour, at the expence of my peace,
till he, who should have been its guar<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-155" id="BPg_2-155"></a>[<a href="images/v2-155.png">155</a>]</span>dian,
laid traps to ensnare me. From
that moment I believed myself, in the
sight of heaven, free&mdash;and no power
on earth shall force me to renounce my
resolution."</p>

<p>The judge, in summing up the evidence,
alluded to "the fallacy of letting
women plead their feelings, as an excuse
for the violation of the marriage-vow.
For his part, he had always
determined to oppose all innovation,
and the new-fangled notions which incroached
on the good old rules of conduct.
We did not want French principles
in public or private life&mdash;and, if
women were allowed to plead their
feelings, as an excuse or palliation of
infidelity, it was opening a flood-gate
for immorality. What virtuous woman
thought of her feelings?&mdash;It was
her duty to love and obey the man<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-156" id="BPg_2-156"></a>[<a href="images/v2-156.png">156</a>]</span>
chosen by her parents and relations,
who were qualified by their experience
to judge better for her, than she could
for herself. As to the charges brought
against the husband, they were vague,
supported by no witnesses, excepting
that of imprisonment in a private mad-house.
The proofs of an insanity in the
family, might render that however a
prudent measure; and indeed the conduct
of the lady did not appear that of
a person of sane mind. Still such a
mode of proceeding could not be justified,
and might perhaps entitle the
lady [in another court] to a sentence of
separation from bed and board, during
the joint lives of the parties; but he
hoped that no Englishman would legalize
adultery, by enabling the adulteress
to enrich her seducer. Too many restrictions
could not be thrown in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-157" id="BPg_2-157"></a>[<a href="images/v2-157.png">157</a>]</span>
way of divorces, if we wished to maintain
the sanctity of marriage; and,
though they might bear a little hard on
a few, very few individuals, it was
evidently for the good of the whole."</p>

<p>"She swallowed the laudanum; her
soul was calm&mdash;the tempest had sub<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-162" id="BPg_2-162"></a>[<a href="images/v2-162.png">162</a>]</span>sided&mdash;and
nothing remained but an
eager longing to forget herself&mdash;to
fly from the anguish she endured
to escape from thought&mdash;from this
hell of disappointment.</p>

<p>"Still her eyes closed not&mdash;one remembrance
with frightful velocity followed
another&mdash;All the incidents of
her life were in arms, embodied to
assail her, and prevent her sinking
into the sleep of death.&mdash;Her murdered
child again appeared to her,
mourning for the babe of which she
was the tomb.&mdash;'And could it have
a nobler?&mdash;Surely it is better to die
with me, than to enter on life without
a mother's care!&mdash;I cannot live!&mdash;but
could I have deserted my child the
moment it was born?&mdash;thrown it on
the troubled wave of life, without
a hand to support it?'&mdash;She looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-163" id="BPg_2-163"></a>[<a href="images/v2-163.png">163</a>]</span>
up: 'What have I not suffered!&mdash;may
I find a father where I am going!'&mdash;Her
head turned; a stupor ensued;
a faintness&mdash;'Have a little patience,'
said Maria, holding her swimming
head (she thought of her mother),
'this cannot last long; and what is a
little bodily pain to the pangs I have
endured?'</p>

<p>"A new vision swam before her.
Jemima seemed to enter&mdash;leading a little
creature, that, with tottering footsteps,
approached the bed. The voice
of Jemima sounding as at a distance,
called her&mdash;she tried to listen, to speak,
to look!</p>

<p>"'Behold your child!' exclaimed
Jemima. Maria started off the bed,
and fainted.&mdash;Violent vomiting followed.</p>

<p>"When she was restored to life, Je<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-164" id="BPg_2-164"></a>[<a href="images/v2-164.png">164</a>]</span>mima
addressed her with great solemnity:
'&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; led me to suspect,
that your husband and brother had
deceived you, and secreted the child.
I would not torment you with doubtful
hopes, and I left you (at a fatal
moment) to search for the child!&mdash;I
snatched her from misery&mdash;and (now
she is alive again) would you leave
her alone in the world, to endure what
I have endured?'</p>

<p>"Maria gazed wildly at her, her
whole frame was convulsed with emotion;
when the child, whom Jemima
had been tutoring all the journey, uttered
the word 'Mamma!' She
caught her to her bosom, and burst
into a passion of tears&mdash;then, resting
the child gently on the bed, as if
afraid of killing it,&mdash;she put her hand
to her eyes, to conceal as it were the<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-165" id="BPg_2-165"></a>[<a href="images/v2-165.png">165</a>]</span>
agonizing struggle of her soul. She
remained silent for five minutes, crossing
her arms over her bosom, and reclining
her head,&mdash;then exclaimed:
'The conflict is over!&mdash;I will live for
my child!'"</p>

<hr />

<p>A few readers perhaps, in looking
over these hints, will wonder how it
could have been practicable, without
tediousness, or remitting in any degree
the interest of the story, to have filled,
from these slight sketches, a number of
pages, more considerable than those
which have been already presented.
But, in reality, these hints, simple as
they are, are pregnant with passion and
distress. It is the refuge of barren au<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-166" id="BPg_2-166"></a>[<a href="images/v2-166.png">166</a>]</span>thors
only, to crowd their fictions with
so great a number of events, as to suffer
no one of them to sink into the reader's
mind. It is the province of true genius
to develop events, to discover their
capabilities, to ascertain the different
passions and sentiments with which they
are fraught, and to diversify them with
incidents, that give reality to the picture,
and take a hold upon the mind of a
reader of taste, from which they can
never be loosened. It was particularly
the design of the author, in the present
instance, to make her story subordinate
to a great moral purpose, that "of exhibiting
the misery and oppression, peculiar
to women, that arise out of the
partial laws and customs of society.&mdash;This
view restrained her fancy<a name="BFNanchor_166-A_10" id="BFNanchor_166-A_10"></a><a href="#BFootnote_166-A_10" class="fnanchor">[166-A]</a>." It<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-167" id="BPg_2-167"></a>[<a href="images/v2-167.png">167</a>]</span>
was necessary for her, to place in a striking
point of view, evils that are too
frequently overlooked, and to drag into
light those details of oppression, of
which the grosser and more insensible
part of mankind make little account.</p>

<h2>ADVERTISEMENT,</h2>

<h3>BY THE EDITOR.</h3>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following pages will, I believe,
be judged by every reader of taste to
have been worth preserving, among
the other testimonies the author left
behind her, of her genius and the
soundness of her understanding. To<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-172" id="BPg_2-172"></a>[<a href="images/v2-172.png">172</a>]</span>
such readers I leave the task of comparing
these lessons, with other works
of the same nature previously published.
It is obvious that the author has struck
out a path of her own, and by no means
intrenched upon the plans of her predecessors.</p>

<p>It may however excite surprise in
some persons to find these papers annexed
to the conclusion of a novel. All
I have to offer on this subject, consists
in the following considerations:</p>

<p>First, something is to be allowed for
the difficulty of arranging the miscellaneous
papers upon very different sub<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-173" id="BPg_2-173"></a>[<a href="images/v2-173.png">173</a>]</span>jects,
which will frequently constitute
an author's posthumous works.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Secondly, the small portion they occupy
in the present volume, will perhaps
be accepted as an apology, by
such good-natured readers (if any such
there are), to whom the perusal of
them shall be a matter of perfect indifference.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Thirdly, the circumstance which
determined me in annexing them to
the present work, was the slight association
(in default of a strong one)
between the affectionate and pathetic
manner in which Maria Venables ad<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-174" id="BPg_2-174"></a>[<a href="images/v2-174.png">174</a>]</span>dresses
her infant, in the Wrongs of
Woman; and the agonising and painful
sentiment with which the author
originally bequeathed these papers, as
a legacy for the benefit of her child.</p>

Dog. Eat the bread. Drink the milk.

Shut the door. Bring the chair. Ring

<p>Hide your face. Wipe your nose.
Wash your hands. Dirty hands. Why
do you cry? A clean mouth. Shake
hands. I love you. Kiss me now.
Good girl.</p>

<p>The bird sings. The fire burns.
The cat jumps. The dog runs. The
bird flies. The cow lies down. The man
laughs. The child cries.</p>

<p class="center">LESSON IV.</p>

<p>LET me comb your head. Ask Betty
to wash your face. Go and see for
some bread. Drink milk, if you are
dry. Play on the floor with the ball.
Do not touch the ink; you will black
your hands.</p>

<p>What do you want to say to me?
Speak slow, not so fast. Did you fall?
You will not cry, not you; the baby
cries. Will you walk in the fields?</p>


<p class="center">LESSON V.</p>

<p>COME to me, my little girl. Are
you tired of playing? Yes. Sit down
and rest yourself, while I talk to you.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-180" id="BPg_2-180"></a>[<a href="images/v2-180.png">180</a>]</span>
Have you seen the baby? Poor little
thing. O here it comes. Look
at him. How helpless he is. Four
years ago you were as feeble as this
very little boy.</p>

<p>See, he cannot hold up his head.
He is forced to lie on his back, if his
mamma do not turn him to the right or
left side, he will soon begin to cry.
He cries to tell her, that he is tired
with lying on his back.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON VI.</p>

<p>PERHAPS he is hungry. What
shall we give him to eat? Poor fellow,
he cannot eat. Look in his mouth, he
has no teeth.</p>

<p>How did you do when you were a baby
like him? You cannot tell. Do you
want to know? Look then at the dog,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-181" id="BPg_2-181"></a>[<a href="images/v2-181.png">181</a>]</span>
with her pretty puppy. You could
not help yourself as well as the puppy.
You could only open your mouth,
when you were lying, like William, on
my knee. So I put you to my breast,
and you sucked, as the puppy sucks
now, for there was milk enough for
you.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON VII.</p>

<p>WHEN you were hungry, you began
to cry, because you could not speak.
You were seven months without teeth,
always sucking. But after you got
one, you began to gnaw a crust of
bread. It was not long before another
came pop. At ten months you had
four pretty white teeth, and you used
to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did
not cry, because I am not a child, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-182" id="BPg_2-182"></a>[<a href="images/v2-182.png">182</a>]</span>
you hurt me very much. So I said to
papa, it is time the little girl should
eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts
me. I have given her a crust of bread,
and I must look for some other milk.</p>

<p>The cow has got plenty, and her
jumping calf eats grass very well. He
has got more teeth than my little girl.
Yes, says papa, and he tapped you on
the cheek, you are old enough to learn
to eat? Come to me, and I will teach
you, my little dear, for you must not
hurt poor mamma, who has given you
her milk, when you could not take any
thing else.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON VIII.</p>

<p>YOU were then on the carpet, for
you could not walk well. So when
you were in a hurry, you used to run<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-183" id="BPg_2-183"></a>[<a href="images/v2-183.png">183</a>]</span>
quick, quick, quick, on your hands
and feet, like the dog.</p>

<p>Away you ran to papa, and putting
both your arms round his leg, for your
hands were not big enough, you looked
up at him, and laughed. What did
this laugh say, when you could not
speak? Cannot you guess by what you
now say to papa?&mdash;Ah! it was, Play
with me, papa!&mdash;play with me!</p>

<p>Papa began to smile, and you knew
that the smile was always&mdash;Yes. So
you got a ball, and papa threw it along
the floor&mdash;Roll&mdash;roll&mdash;roll; and you
ran after it again&mdash;and again. How
pleased you were. Look at William,
he smiles; but you could laugh loud&mdash;Ha!
ha! ha!&mdash;Papa laughed louder
than the little girl, and rolled the ball
still faster.</p>

<p>Then he put the ball on a chair, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-184" id="BPg_2-184"></a>[<a href="images/v2-184.png">184</a>]</span>
you were forced to take hold of the
back, and stand up to reach it. At
last you reached too far, and down you
fell: not indeed on your face, because
you put out your hands. You were not
much hurt; but the palms of your
hands smarted with the pain, and you
began to cry, like a little child.</p>

<p>It is only very little children who cry
when they are hurt; and it is to tell
their mamma, that something is the
matter with them. Now you can come
to me, and say, Mamma, I have hurt
myself. Pray rub my hand: it smarts.
Put something on it, to make it well.
A piece of rag, to stop the blood.
You are not afraid of a little blood&mdash;not
you. You scratched your arm with
a pin: it bled a little; but it did you
no harm. See, the skin is grown over
it again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-185" id="BPg_2-185"></a>[<a href="images/v2-185.png">185</a>]</span></p>
<p class="center">LESSON IX.</p>

<p>TAKE care not to put pins in your
mouth, because they will stick in your
throat, and give you pain. Oh! you
cannot think what pain a pin would
give you in your throat, should it remain
there: but, if you by chance
swallow it, I should be obliged to give
you, every morning, something bitter
to drink. You never tasted any thing
so bitter! and you would grow very
sick. I never put pins in my mouth;
but I am older than you, and know how
to take care of myself.</p>

<p>My mamma took care of me, when I
was a little girl, like you. She bade
me never put any thing in my mouth,
without asking her what it was.</p>

<p>When you were a baby, with no more<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-186" id="BPg_2-186"></a>[<a href="images/v2-186.png">186</a>]</span>
sense than William, you put every thing
in your mouth to gnaw, to help your
teeth to cut through the skin. Look
at the puppy, how he bites that piece
of wood. William presses his gums
against my finger. Poor boy! he is so
young, he does not know what he is
doing. When you bite any thing, it is
because you are hungry.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON X.</p>

<p>SEE how much taller you are than
William. In four years you have learned
to eat, to walk, to talk. Why do you
smile? You can do much more, you
think: you can wash your hands and
face. Very well. I should never kiss
a dirty face. And you can comb your
head with the pretty comb you always<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-187" id="BPg_2-187"></a>[<a href="images/v2-187.png">187</a>]</span>
put by in your own drawer. To be
sure, you do all this to be ready to take
a walk with me. You would be obliged
to stay at home, if you could not comb
your own hair. Betty is busy getting
the dinner ready, and only brushes
William's hair, because he cannot do it
for himself.</p>

<p>Betty is making an apple-pye. You
love an apple-pye; but I do not bid
you make one. Your hands are not
strong enough to mix the butter and
flour together; and you must not try to
pare the apples, because you cannot
manage a great knife.</p>

<p>Never touch the large knives: they
are very sharp, and you might cut your
finger to the bone. You are a little
girl, and ought to have a little knife.
When you are as tall as I am, you shall
have a knife as large as mine; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-188" id="BPg_2-188"></a>[<a href="images/v2-188.png">188</a>]</span>
when you are as strong as I am, and
have learned to manage it, you will not
hurt yourself.</p>

<p>You can trundle a hoop, you say;
and jump over a stick. O, I forgot!&mdash;and
march like the men in the red
coats, when papa plays a pretty tune on
the fiddle.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON XI.</p>

<p>WHAT, you think that you shall
soon be able to dress yourself entirely?
I am glad of it: I have something else
to do. You may go, and look for your
frock in the drawer; but I will tie it,
till you are stronger. Betty will tie it,
when I am busy.</p>

<p>I button my gown myself: I do not
want a maid to assist me, when I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-189" id="BPg_2-189"></a>[<a href="images/v2-189.png">189</a>]</span>
dressing. But you have not yet got
sense enough to do it properly, and
must beg somebody to help you, till you
are older.</p>

<p>Children grow older and wiser at the
same time. William is not able to take
a piece of meat, because he has not got
the sense which would make him think
that, without teeth, meat would do him
harm. He cannot tell what is good for
him.</p>

<p>The sense of children grows with
them. You know much more than
William, now you walk alone, and talk;
but you do not know as much as the
boys and girls you see playing yonder,
who are half as tall again as you; and
they do not know half as much as their
fathers and mothers, who are men and
women grown. Papa and I were children,
like you; and men and women<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-190" id="BPg_2-190"></a>[<a href="images/v2-190.png">190</a>]</span>
took care of us. I carry William, because
he is too weak to walk. I lift
you over a stile, and over the gutter,
when you cannot jump over it.</p>

<p>You know already, that potatoes
will not do you any harm: but I must
pluck the fruit for you, till you are wise
enough to know the ripe apples and
pears. The hard ones would make you
sick, and then you must take physic.
You do not love physic: I do not love
it any more than you. But I have more
sense than you; therefore I take care
not to eat unripe fruit, or any thing else
that would make my stomach ache, or
bring out ugly red spots on my face.</p>

<p>When I was a child, my mamma
chose the fruit for me, to prevent my
making myself sick. I was just like
you; I used to ask for what I saw, without
knowing whether it was good or<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-191" id="BPg_2-191"></a>[<a href="images/v2-191.png">191</a>]</span>
bad. Now I have lived a long time, I
know what is good; I do not want any
body to tell me.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON XII.</p>

<p>LOOK at those two dogs. The old
one brings the ball to me in a moment;
the young one does not know how.
He must be taught.</p>

<p>I can cut your shift in a proper shape.
You would not know how to begin.
You would spoil it; but you will learn.</p>

<p>John digs in the garden, and knows
when to put the seed in the ground.
You cannot tell whether it should be in
the winter or summer. Try to find it
out. When do the trees put out their
leaves? In the spring, you say, after the<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-192" id="BPg_2-192"></a>[<a href="images/v2-192.png">192</a>]</span>
cold weather. Fruit would not grow
ripe without very warm weather. Now
I am sure you can guess why the summer
is the season for fruit.</p>

<p>Papa knows that peas and beans are
good for us to eat with our meat. You
are glad when you see them; but if he
did not think for you, and have the
seed put in the ground, we should have
no peas or beans.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON XIII.</p>

<p>POOR child, she cannot do much for
herself. When I let her do any thing
for me, it is to please her: for I could
do it better myself.</p>

<p>Oh! the poor puppy has tumbled
off the stool. Run and stroak him. Put<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-193" id="BPg_2-193"></a>[<a href="images/v2-193.png">193</a>]</span>
a little milk in a saucer to comfort him.
You have more sense than he. You
can pour the milk into the saucer without
spilling it. He would cry for a day
with hunger, without being able to get
it. You are wiser than the dog, you
must help him. The dog will love you
for it, and run after you. I feed you
and take care of you: you love me
and follow me for it.</p>

<p>When the book fell down on your
foot, it gave you great pain. The poor
dog felt the same pain just now.</p>

<p>Take care not to hurt him when you
play with him. And every morning
leave a little milk in your bason for
him. Do not forget to put the bason
in a corner, lest somebody should fall
over it.</p>

<p>When the snow covers the ground,
save the crumbs of bread for the birds.
In the summer they find feed enough,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-194" id="BPg_2-194"></a>[<a href="images/v2-194.png">194</a>]</span>
and do not want you to think about
them.</p>

<p>I make broth for the poor man who
is sick. A sick man is like a child, he
cannot help himself.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON X.</p>

<p>WHEN I caught cold some time
ago, I had such a pain in my head, I
could scarcely hold it up. Papa
opened the door very softly, because
he loves me. You love me, yet you
made a noise. You had not the sense
to know that it made my head worse,
till papa told you.</p>

<p>Papa had a pain in the stomach, and
he would not eat the fine cherries or
grapes on the table. When I brought
him a cup of camomile tea, he drank
it without saying a word, or making<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-195" id="BPg_2-195"></a>[<a href="images/v2-195.png">195</a>]</span>
an ugly face. He knows that I love
him, and that I would not give him
any thing to drink that has a bad taste,
if it were not to do him good.</p>

<p>You asked me for some apples when
your stomach ached; but I was not angry
with you. If you had been as wise
as papa, you would have said, I will
not eat the apples to-day, I must take
some camomile tea.</p>

<p>You say that you do not know how
to think. Yes; you do a little. The
other day papa was tired; he had been
walking about all the morning. After
dinner he fell asleep on the sopha. I
did not bid you be quiet; but you
thought of what papa said to you,
when my head ached. This made you
think that you ought not to make a
noise, when papa was resting himself.
So you came to me, and said to me,
very softly, Pray reach me my ball, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-196" id="BPg_2-196"></a>[<a href="images/v2-196.png">196</a>]</span>
I will go and play in the garden, till
papa wakes.</p>

<p>You were going out; but thinking
again, you came back to me on your
tip-toes. Whisper&mdash;&mdash;whisper. Pray
mama, call me, when papa wakes;
for I shall be afraid to open the door
to see, lest I should disturb him.</p>

<p>Away you went.&mdash;Creep&mdash;creep&mdash;and
shut the door as softly as I could
have done myself.</p>

<p>That was thinking. When a child
does wrong at first, she does not know
any better. But, after she has been told
that she must not disturb mama, when
poor mama is unwell, she thinks herself,
that she must not wake papa when
he is tired.</p>

<p>Another day we will see if you can
think about any thing else.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">I Re&#383;ume</span> my pen to fly from thought.
I was married; and we ha&#383;tened to
London. I had purpo&#383;ed taking one of
my &#383;i&#383;ters with me; for a &#383;trong motive
for marrying, was the de&#383;ire of having
a home at which I could receive them,
now their own grew &#383;o uncomfortable,
as not to de&#383;erve the cheering appellation.
An objection was made to her<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-2_S" id="BPg_2-2_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-2.png">2</a>]</span>
accompanying me, that appeared plau&#383;ible;
and I reluctantly acquie&#383;ced. I
was however willingly allowed to take
with me Molly, poor Peggy's daughter.
London and preferment, are ideas commonly
a&#383;&#383;ociated in the country; and,
as blooming as May, &#383;he bade adieu to
Peggy with weeping eyes. I did not
even feel hurt at the refu&#383;al in relation
to my &#383;i&#383;ter, till hearing what my uncle
had done for me, I had the &#383;implicity
to reque&#383;t, &#383;peaking with warmth of
their &#383;ituation, that he would give them
a thou&#383;and pounds a-piece, which
&#383;eemed to me but ju&#383;tice. He a&#383;ked
me, giving me a ki&#383;s, 'If I had lo&#383;t my
&#383;en&#383;es?' I &#383;tarted back, as if I had
found a wa&#383;p in a ro&#383;e-bu&#383;h. I expo&#383;tulated.
He &#383;neered; and the demon
of di&#383;cord entered our paradi&#383;e, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-3_S" id="BPg_2-3_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-3.png">3</a>]</span>
poi&#383;on with his pe&#383;tiferous breath every
opening joy.</p>

<p>"I had &#383;ometimes ob&#383;erved defects
in my hu&#383;band's under&#383;tanding; but, led
a&#383;tray by a prevailing opinion, that
goodne&#383;s of di&#383;po&#383;ition is of the fir&#383;t importance
in the relative &#383;ituations of
life, in proportion as I perceived the
narrowne&#383;s of his under&#383;tanding, fancy
enlarged the boundary of his heart.
Fatal error! How quickly is the &#383;o
much vaunted milkine&#383;s of nature turned
into gall, by an intercour&#383;e with the
world, if more generous juices do not
&#383;u&#383;tain the vital &#383;ource of virtue!</p>

<p>"One trait in my character was extreme
credulity; but, when my eyes were
once opened, I &#383;aw but too clearly all
I had before overlooked. My hu&#383;band
was &#383;unk in my e&#383;teem; &#383;till there are
youthful emotions, which, for a while,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-4_S" id="BPg_2-4_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-4.png">4</a>]</span>
fill up the cha&#383;m of love and friend&#383;hip.
Be&#383;ides, it required &#383;ome time to enable
me to &#383;ee his whole character in a
ju&#383;t light, or rather to allow it to become
fixed. While circum&#383;tances were
ripening my faculties, and cultivating
my ta&#383;te, commerce and gro&#383;s relaxations
were &#383;hutting his again&#383;t any
po&#383;&#383;ibility of improvement, till, by
&#383;tifling every &#383;park of virtue in him&#383;elf,
he began to imagine that it no where
exi&#383;ted.</p>

<p>"Do not let me lead you a&#383;tray, my
child, I do not mean to a&#383;&#383;ert, that
any human being is entirely incapable
of feeling the generous emotions, which
are the foundation of every true principle
of virtue; but they are frequently,
I fear, &#383;o feeble, that, like the inflammable
quality which more or le&#383;s
lurks in all bodies, they often lie for<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-5_S" id="BPg_2-5_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-5.png">5</a>]</span>
ever dormant; the circum&#383;tances never
occurring, nece&#383;&#383;ary to call them into
action.</p>

<p>"I di&#383;covered however by chance,
that, in con&#383;equence of &#383;ome lo&#383;&#383;es in
trade, the natural effect of his gambling
de&#383;ire to &#383;tart &#383;uddenly into riches,
the five thou&#383;and pounds given me by
my uncle, had been paid very opportunely.
This di&#383;covery, &#383;trange as you
may think the a&#383;&#383;ertion, gave me plea&#383;ure;
my hu&#383;band's embarra&#383;&#383;ments
endeared him to me. I was glad to
find an excu&#383;e for his conduct to my
&#383;i&#383;ters, and my mind became calmer.</p>

<p>"My uncle introduced me to &#383;ome
literary &#383;ociety; and the theatres were
a never-failing &#383;ource of amu&#383;ement to
me. My delighted eye followed Mrs.
Siddons, when, with dignified delicacy,
&#383;he played Cali&#383;ta; and I involuntarily<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-6_S" id="BPg_2-6_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-6.png">6</a>]</span>
repeated after her, in the &#383;ame tone,
and with a long-drawn &#383;igh,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Hearts like our's were pair'd&mdash;not match'd.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The&#383;e were, at fir&#383;t, &#383;pontaneous
emotions, though, becoming acquainted
with men of wit and poli&#383;hed manners,
I could not &#383;ometimes help regretting
my early marriage; and that,
in my ha&#383;te to e&#383;cape from a temporary
dependence, and expand my newly
fledged wings, in an unknown &#383;ky, I
had been caught in a trap, and caged
for life. Still the novelty of London,
and the attentive fondne&#383;s of my hu&#383;band,
for he had &#383;ome per&#383;onal regard
for me, made &#383;everal months glide
away. Yet, not forgetting the &#383;ituation
of my &#383;i&#383;ters, who were &#383;till very
young, I prevailed on my uncle to &#383;et<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-7_S" id="BPg_2-7_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-7.png">7</a>]</span>tle
a thou&#383;and pounds on each; and
to place them in a &#383;chool near town,
where I could frequently vi&#383;it, as well
as have them at home with me.</p>

<p>"I now tried to improve my hu&#383;band's
ta&#383;te, but we had few &#383;ubjects in
common; indeed he &#383;oon appeared
to have little reli&#383;h for my &#383;ociety, unle&#383;s
he was hinting to me the u&#383;e he
could make of my uncle's wealth.
When we had company, I was di&#383;gu&#383;ted
by an o&#383;tentatious di&#383;play of
riches, and I have often quitted the
room, to avoid li&#383;tening to exaggerated
tales of money obtained by lucky hits.</p>

<p>"With all my attention and affectionate
intere&#383;t, I perceived that I
could not become the friend or confident
of my hu&#383;band. Every thing I
learned relative to his affairs I gathered
up by accident; and I vainly endea<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-8_S" id="BPg_2-8_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-8.png">8</a>]</span>voured
to e&#383;tabli&#383;h, at our fire-&#383;ide,
that &#383;ocial conver&#383;e, which often renders
people of different characters dear to
each other. Returning from the theatre,
or any amu&#383;ing party, I frequently
began to relate what I had &#383;een and
highly reli&#383;hed; but with &#383;ullen taciturnity
he &#383;oon &#383;ilenced me. I &#383;eemed
therefore gradually to lo&#383;e, in his &#383;ociety,
the &#383;oul, the energies of which
had ju&#383;t been in action. To &#383;uch a degree,
in fact, did his cold, re&#383;erved
manner affect me, that, after &#383;pending
&#383;ome days with him alone, I have
imagined my&#383;elf the mo&#383;t &#383;tupid creature
in the world, till the abilities of
&#383;ome ca&#383;ual vi&#383;itor convinced me that I
had &#383;ome dormant animation, and &#383;entiments
above the du&#383;t in which I had
been groveling. The very countenance
of my hu&#383;band changed; his com<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-9_S" id="BPg_2-9_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-9.png">9</a>]</span>plexion
became &#383;allow, and all the
charms of youth were vani&#383;hing with
its vivacity.</p>

<p>"I give you one view of the &#383;ubject;
but the&#383;e experiments and alterations
took up the &#383;pace of five years; during
which period, I had mo&#383;t reluctantly extorted
&#383;everal &#383;ums from my uncle, to
&#383;ave my hu&#383;band, to u&#383;e his own words,
from de&#383;truction. At fir&#383;t it was to prevent
bills being noted, to the injury of
his credit; then to bail him; and afterwards
to prevent an execution from
entering the hou&#383;e. I began at la&#383;t to
conclude, that he would have made
more exertions of his own to extricate
him&#383;elf, had he not relied on mine,
cruel as was the ta&#383;k he impo&#383;ed on me;
and I firmly determined that I would
make u&#383;e of no more pretexts.</p>

<p>"From the moment I pronounced<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-10_S" id="BPg_2-10_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-10.png">10</a>]</span>
this determination, indifference on his
part was changed into rudene&#383;s, or
&#383;omething wor&#383;e.</p>

<p>"He now &#383;eldom dined at home,
and continually returned at a late hour,
drunk, to bed. I retired to another
apartment; I was glad, I own, to
e&#383;cape from his; for per&#383;onal intimacy
without affection, &#383;eemed, to me the
mo&#383;t degrading, as well as the mo&#383;t
painful &#383;tate in which a woman of any
ta&#383;te, not to &#383;peak of the peculiar delicacy
of fo&#383;tered &#383;en&#383;ibility, could be
placed. But my hu&#383;band's fondne&#383;s
for women was of the gro&#383;&#383;e&#383;t kind,
and imagination was &#383;o wholly out of
the que&#383;tion, as to render his indulgences
of this &#383;ort entirely promi&#383;cuous,
and of the mo&#383;t brutal nature.
My health &#383;uffered, before my heart
was entirely e&#383;tranged by the loath<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-11_S" id="BPg_2-11_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-11.png">11</a>]</span>&#383;ome
information; could I then have
returned to his &#383;ullied arms, but as a
victim to the prejudices of mankind,
who have made women the property of
their hu&#383;bands? I di&#383;covered even,
by his conver&#383;ation, when intoxicated,
that his favourites were wantons of the
lowe&#383;t cla&#383;s, who could by their vulgar,
indecent mirth, which he called nature,
rou&#383;e his &#383;luggi&#383;h &#383;pirits. Meretricious
ornaments and manners were
nece&#383;&#383;ary to attract his attention. He
&#383;eldom looked twice at a mode&#383;t woman,
and &#383;at &#383;ilent in their company;
and the charms of youth and beauty
had not the &#383;lighte&#383;t effect on his &#383;en&#383;es,
unle&#383;s the po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ors were initiated in
vice. His intimacy with profligate women,
and his habits of thinking, gave
him a contempt for female endowments;
and he would repeat, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-12_S" id="BPg_2-12_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-12.png">12</a>]</span>
wine had loo&#383;ed his tongue, mo&#383;t of the
common-place &#383;arca&#383;ms levelled at
them, by men who do not allow them
to have minds, becau&#383;e mind would be
an impediment to gro&#383;s enjoyment.
Men who are inferior to their fellow
men, are always mo&#383;t anxious to e&#383;tabli&#383;h
their &#383;uperiority over women.
But where are the&#383;e reflections leading
me?</p>

<p>"Women who have lo&#383;t their hu&#383;band's
affection, are ju&#383;tly reproved for
neglecting their per&#383;ons, and not taking
the &#383;ame pains to keep, as to gain a
heart; but who thinks of giving the
&#383;ame advice to men, though women
are continually &#383;tigmatized for being
attached to fops; and from the nature
of their education, are more &#383;u&#383;ceptible
of di&#383;gu&#383;t? Yet why a woman &#383;hould
be expected to endure a &#383;loven, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-13_S" id="BPg_2-13_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-13.png">13</a>]</span>
more patience than a man, and magnanimou&#383;ly
to govern her&#383;elf, I cannot
conceive; unle&#383;s it be &#383;uppo&#383;ed arrogant
in her to look for re&#383;pect as well as a
maintenance. It is not ea&#383;y to be
plea&#383;ed, becau&#383;e, after promi&#383;ing to
love, in different circum&#383;tances, we are
told that it is our duty. I cannot, I
am &#383;ure (though, when attending the
&#383;ick, I never felt di&#383;gu&#383;t) forget my
own &#383;en&#383;ations, when ri&#383;ing with health
and &#383;pirit, and after &#383;centing the &#383;weet
morning, I have met my hu&#383;band at
the breakfa&#383;t table. The active attention
I had been giving to dome&#383;tic regulations,
which were generally &#383;ettled
before he ro&#383;e, or a walk, gave a glow
to my countenance, that contra&#383;ted with
his &#383;quallid appearance. The &#383;queami&#383;hne&#383;s
of &#383;tomach alone, produced
by the la&#383;t night's intemperance, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-14_S" id="BPg_2-14_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-14.png">14</a>]</span>
he took no pains to conceal, de&#383;troyed
my appetite. I think I now &#383;ee him
lolling in an arm-chair, in a dirty powdering
gown, &#383;oiled linen, ungartered
&#383;tockings, and tangled hair, yawning
and &#383;tretching him&#383;elf. The new&#383;paper
was immediately called for, if not
brought in on the tea-board, from
which he would &#383;carcely lift his eyes
while I poured out the tea, excepting
to a&#383;k for &#383;ome brandy to put into it, or
to declare that he could not eat. In
an&#383;wer to any que&#383;tion, in his be&#383;t humour,
it was a drawling 'What do
you &#383;ay, child?' But if I demanded
money for the hou&#383;e expences, which I
put off till the la&#383;t moment, his cu&#383;tomary
reply, often prefaced with an
oath, was, 'Do you think me, madam,
made of money?'&mdash;The butcher,
the baker, mu&#383;t wait; and, what was<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-15_S" id="BPg_2-15_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-15.png">15</a>]</span>
wor&#383;e, I was often obliged to witne&#383;s
his &#383;urly di&#383;mi&#383;&#383;ion of trade&#383;men, who
were in want of their money, and
whom I &#383;ometimes paid with the pre&#383;ents
my uncle gave me for my own
u&#383;e.</p>

<p><ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added mi&#383;&#383;ing quotation mark">"</ins>At this juncture my father's mi&#383;tre&#383;s,
by terrifying his con&#383;cience, prevailed
on him to marry her; he was already
become a methodi&#383;t; and my brother,
who now practi&#383;ed for him&#383;elf, had di&#383;covered
a flaw in the &#383;ettlement made
on my mother's children, which &#383;et it
a&#383;ide, and he allowed my father, who&#383;e

were accompli&#383;hed, yet you can (may
you never be reduced to the &#383;ame de&#383;titute
&#383;tate!) &#383;carcely conceive the trouble
I had to place them in the &#383;ituation
of governe&#383;&#383;es, the only one in which
even a well-educated woman, with
more than ordinary talents, can &#383;truggle
for a &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence; and even this is a
dependence next to menial. Is it then
&#383;urpri&#383;ing, that &#383;o many forlorn women,
with human pa&#383;&#383;ions and feelings, take
refuge in infamy? Alone in large man&#383;ions,
I &#383;ay alone, becau&#383;e they had no
companions with whom they could conver&#383;e
on equal terms, or from whom
they could expect the endearments of
affection, they grew melancholy, and
the &#383;ound of joy made them &#383;ad; and
the younge&#383;t, having a more delicate
frame, fell into a decline. It was with<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-17_S" id="BPg_2-17_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-17.png">17</a>]</span>
great difficulty that I, who now almo&#383;t
&#383;upported the hou&#383;e by loans from my
uncle, could prevail on the <i>ma&#383;ter</i> of it,
to allow her a room to die in. I watched
her &#383;ick bed for &#383;ome months, and then
clo&#383;ed her eyes, gentle &#383;pirit! for ever.
She was pretty, with very engaging
manners; yet had never an opportunity
to marry, excepting to a very old man.
She had abilities &#383;ufficient to have
&#383;hone in any profe&#383;&#383;ion, had there been
any profe&#383;&#383;ions for women, though &#383;he
&#383;hrunk at the name of milliner or mantua-maker
as degrading to a gentlewoman.
I would not term this feeling
fal&#383;e pride to any one but you, my
child, whom I fondly hope to &#383;ee (yes;
I will indulge the hope for a moment!)
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed of that energy of character
which gives dignity to any &#383;tation; and
with that clear, firm &#383;pirit that will en<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-18_S" id="BPg_2-18_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-18.png">18</a>]</span>able
you to choo&#383;e a &#383;ituation for your&#383;elf,
or &#383;ubmit to be cla&#383;&#383;ed in the lowe&#383;t,
if it be the only one in which you
can be the mi&#383;tre&#383;s of your own actions.</p>

<p>"Soon after the death of my &#383;i&#383;ter,
an incident occurred, to prove to me that
the heart of a libertine is dead to natural
affection; and to convince me,
that the being who has appeared all
tenderne&#383;s, to gratify a &#383;elfi&#383;h pa&#383;&#383;ion,
is as regardle&#383;s of the innocent fruit of
it, as of the object, when the fit is over.
I had ca&#383;ually ob&#383;erved an old, mean-looking
woman, who called on my hu&#383;band
every two or three months to receive
&#383;ome money. One day entering
the pa&#383;&#383;age of his little counting-hou&#383;e,
as &#383;he was going out, I
heard her &#383;ay, 'The child is very weak;
&#383;he cannot live long, &#383;he will &#383;oon die<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-19_S" id="BPg_2-19_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-19.png">19</a>]</span>
out of your way, &#383;o you need not grudge
her a little phy&#383;ic.'</p>

<p>"'So much the better,' he replied,
'and pray mind your own bu&#383;ine&#383;s,
good woman.'</p>

<p>"I was &#383;truck by his unfeeling, inhuman
tone of voice, and drew back,
determined when the woman came
again, to try to &#383;peak to her, not out
of curio&#383;ity, I had heard enough, but
with the hope of being u&#383;eful to a poor,
outca&#383;t girl.</p>

<p>"A month or two elap&#383;ed before I
&#383;aw this woman again; and then &#383;he
had a child in her hand that tottered
along, &#383;carcely able to &#383;u&#383;tain her own
weight. They were going away, to
return at the hour Mr. Venables was
expected; he was now from home. I
de&#383;ired the woman to walk into the
parlour. She he&#383;itated, yet obeyed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-20_S" id="BPg_2-20_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-20.png">20</a>]</span>
I a&#383;&#383;ured her that I &#383;hould not mention
to my hu&#383;band (the word &#383;eemed to
weigh on my re&#383;piration), that I had &#383;een
her, or his child. The woman &#383;tared
at me with a&#383;toni&#383;hment; and I turned
my eyes on the &#383;qualid object [that accompanied
her.] She could hardly &#383;upport
her&#383;elf, her complexion was &#383;allow,
and her eyes inflamed, with an inde&#383;cribable
look of cunning, mixed with
the wrinkles produced by the peevi&#383;hne&#383;s
of pain.</p>

<p>"<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added mi&#383;&#383;ing quotation mark">'</ins>Poor child!' I exclaimed. 'Ah!
you may well &#383;ay poor child,' replied
the woman. 'I brought her here to &#383;ee
whether he would have the heart to
look at her, and not get &#383;ome advice.
I do not know what they de&#383;erve who
nur&#383;ed her. Why, her legs bent under
her like a bow when &#383;he came to me,
and &#383;he has never been well &#383;ince; but,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-21_S" id="BPg_2-21_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-21.png">21</a>]</span>
if they were no better paid than I am,
it is not to be wondered at, &#383;ure
enough.'</p>

<p>"On further enquiry I was informed,
that this mi&#383;erable &#383;pectacle was the
daughter of a &#383;ervant, a country girl,
who caught Mr. Venables' eye, and
whom he &#383;educed. On his marriage he
&#383;ent her away, her &#383;ituation being too
vi&#383;ible. After her delivery, &#383;he was
thrown on the town; and died in an
ho&#383;pital within the year. The babe
was &#383;ent to a pari&#383;h-nur&#383;e, and afterwards
to this woman, who did not
&#383;eem much better; but what was to be
expected from &#383;uch a clo&#383;e bargain?
She was only paid three &#383;hillings a week
for board and wa&#383;hing.</p>

<p>"The woman begged me to give her
&#383;ome old clothes for the child, a&#383;&#383;uring
me, that &#383;he was almo&#383;t afraid to a&#383;k<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-22_S" id="BPg_2-22_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-22.png">22</a>]</span>
ma&#383;ter for money to buy even a pair
of &#383;hoes.</p>

<p>"I grew &#383;ick at heart. And, fearing
Mr. Venables might enter, and oblige
me to expre&#383;s my abhorrence, I ha&#383;tily
enquired where &#383;he lived, promi&#383;ed to
pay her two &#383;hillings a week more, and
to call on her in a day or two; putting
a trifle into her hand as a proof of my
good intention.</p>

<p>"If the &#383;tate of this child affected me,
what were my feelings at a di&#383;covery I

<p>"<span class="smcap">My</span> father's &#383;ituation was now &#383;o
di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;ing, that I prevailed on my uncle
to accompany me to vi&#383;it him; and
to lend me his a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance, to prevent the
whole property of the family from becoming
the prey of my brother's rapacity;
for, to extricate him&#383;elf out of
pre&#383;ent difficulties, my father was totally
regardle&#383;s of futurity. I took
down with me &#383;ome pre&#383;ents for my
&#383;tep-mother; it did not require an effort
for me to treat her with civility, or
to forget the pa&#383;t.</p>

<p>"This was the fir&#383;t time I had vi&#383;ited
my native village, &#383;ince my marriage.
But with what different emotions did
I return from the bu&#383;y world, with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-24_S" id="BPg_2-24_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-24.png">24</a>]</span>
heavy weight of experience benumbing
my imagination, to &#383;cenes, that whi&#383;pered
recollections of joy and hope
mo&#383;t eloquently to my heart! The
fir&#383;t &#383;cent of the wild flowers from the
heath, thrilled through my veins, awakening
every &#383;en&#383;e to plea&#383;ure. The icy
hand of de&#383;pair &#383;eemed to be removed
from my bo&#383;om; and&mdash;forgetting my
hu&#383;band&mdash;the nurtured vi&#383;ions of a romantic
mind, bur&#383;ting on me with all
their original wildne&#383;s and gay exuberance,
were again hailed as &#383;weet realities.
I forgot, with equal facility,
that I ever felt &#383;orrow, or knew care
in the country; while a tran&#383;ient rainbow
&#383;tole athwart the cloudy &#383;ky of de&#383;pondency.
The picture&#383;que form of
&#383;everal favourite trees, and the porches
of rude cottages, with their &#383;miling
hedges, were recognized with the glad<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-25_S" id="BPg_2-25_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-25.png">25</a>]</span>&#383;ome
playfulne&#383;s of childi&#383;h vivacity.
I could have ki&#383;&#383;ed the chickens that
pecked on the common; and longed to
pat the cows, and frolic with the dogs
that &#383;ported on it. I gazed with delight
on the windmill, and thought it
lucky that it &#383;hould be in motion, at
the moment I pa&#383;&#383;ed by; and entering
the dear green lane, which led directly
to the village, the &#383;ound of the well-known
rookery gave that &#383;entimental
tinge to the varying &#383;en&#383;ations of my
active &#383;oul, which only &#383;erved to
heighten the lu&#383;tre of the luxuriant
&#383;cenery. But, &#383;pying, as I advanced,
the &#383;pire, peeping over the withered tops
of the aged elms that compo&#383;ed the
rookery, my thoughts flew immediately
to the church-yard, and tears of affection,
&#383;uch was the effect of my imagination,
bedewed my mother's grave!<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-26_S" id="BPg_2-26_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-26.png">26</a>]</span>
Sorrow gave place to devotional feelings.
I wandered through the church
in fancy, as I u&#383;ed &#383;ometimes to do on
a Saturday evening. I recollected with
what fervour I addre&#383;&#383;ed the God of
my youth: and once more with rapturous
love looked above my &#383;orrows
to the Father of nature. I pau&#383;e&mdash;feeling
forcibly all the emotions I am de&#383;cribing;
and (reminded, as I regi&#383;ter
my &#383;orrows, of the &#383;ublime calm I have
felt, when in &#383;ome tremendous &#383;olitude,
my &#383;oul re&#383;ted on it&#383;elf, and
&#383;eemed to fill the univer&#383;e) I in&#383;en&#383;ibly
breathe &#383;oft, hu&#383;hing every wayward
emotion, as if fearing to &#383;ully with a
&#383;igh, a contentment &#383;o extatic.</p>

<p>"Having &#383;ettled my father's affairs,
and, by my exertions in his favour, made
my brother my &#383;worn foe, I returned
to London. My hu&#383;band's conduct<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-27_S" id="BPg_2-27_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-27.png">27</a>]</span>
was now changed; I had during my
ab&#383;ence, received &#383;everal affectionate,
penitential letters from him; and he
&#383;eemed on my arrival, to wi&#383;h by his
behaviour to prove his &#383;incerity. I
could not then conceive why he acted
thus; and, when the &#383;u&#383;picion darted
into my head, that it might ari&#383;e from
ob&#383;erving my increa&#383;ing influence with
my uncle, I almo&#383;t de&#383;pi&#383;ed my&#383;elf for
imagining that &#383;uch a degree of deba&#383;ing
&#383;elfi&#383;hne&#383;s could exi&#383;t.</p>

<p>"He became, unaccountable as was
the change, tender and attentive; and,
attacking my weak &#383;ide, made a confe&#383;&#383;ion
of his follies, and lamented the
embarra&#383;&#383;ments in which I, who merited
a far different fate, might be involved.
He be&#383;ought me to aid him with my
coun&#383;el, prai&#383;ed my under&#383;tanding, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-28_S" id="BPg_2-28_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-28.png">28</a>]</span>
appealed to the tenderne&#383;s of my
heart.</p>

<p>"This conduct only in&#383;pired me with
compa&#383;&#383;ion. I wi&#383;hed to be his friend;
but love had &#383;pread his ro&#383;y pinions,
and fled far, far away; and had not
(like &#383;ome exqui&#383;ite perfumes, the fine
&#383;pirit of which is continually mingling
with the air) left a fragrance behind,
to mark where he had &#383;hook his wings.
My hu&#383;band's renewed care&#383;&#383;es then
became hateful to me; his brutality
was tolerable, compared to his di&#383;ta&#383;teful
fondne&#383;s. Still, compa&#383;&#383;ion, and
the fear of in&#383;ulting his &#383;uppo&#383;ed feelings,
by a want of &#383;ympathy, made
me di&#383;&#383;emble, and do violence to my
delicacy. What a ta&#383;k!</p>

<p>"Tho&#383;e who &#383;upport a &#383;y&#383;tem of
what I term fal&#383;e refinement, and will<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-29_S" id="BPg_2-29_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-29.png">29</a>]</span>
not allow great part of love in the female,
as well as male brea&#383;t, to &#383;pring
in &#383;ome re&#383;pects involuntarily, may not
admit that charms are as nece&#383;&#383;ary to
feed the pa&#383;&#383;ion, as virtues to convert
the mellowing &#383;pirit into friend&#383;hip. To
&#383;uch ob&#383;ervers I have nothing to &#383;ay,
any more than to the morali&#383;ts, who in&#383;i&#383;t
that women ought to, and can love
their hu&#383;bands, becau&#383;e it is their duty.
To you, my child, I may add, with a
heart tremblingly alive to your future
conduct, &#383;ome ob&#383;ervations, dictated
by my pre&#383;ent feelings, on calmly reviewing
this period of my life. When
noveli&#383;ts or morali&#383;ts prai&#383;e as a virtue,
a woman's coldne&#383;s of con&#383;titution, and
want of pa&#383;&#383;ion; and make her yield
to the ardour of her lover out of &#383;heer
compa&#383;&#383;ion, or to promote a frigid plan
of future comfort, I am di&#383;gu&#383;ted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-30_S" id="BPg_2-30_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-30.png">30</a>]</span>
They may be good women, in the ordinary
acceptation of the phra&#383;e, and do
no harm; but they appear to me not to
have tho&#383;e 'finely fa&#383;hioned nerves,'
which render the &#383;en&#383;es exqui&#383;ite. They
may po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s tenderne&#383;s; but they want
that fire of the imagination, which produces
<i>active</i> &#383;en&#383;ibility, and <i>po&#383;itive</i> virtue.
How does the woman de&#383;erve to
be characterized, who marries one man,
with a heart and imagination devoted
to another? Is &#383;he not an object of
pity or contempt, when thus &#383;acrilegiou&#383;ly
violating the purity of her own
feelings? Nay, it is as indelicate, when
&#383;he is indifferent, unle&#383;s &#383;he be con&#383;titutionally
in&#383;en&#383;ible; then indeed it is
a mere affair of barter; and I have nothing
to do with the &#383;ecrets of trade.
Yes; eagerly as I wi&#383;h you to po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s
true rectitude of mind, and purity of<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-31_S" id="BPg_2-31_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-31.png">31</a>]</span>
affection, I mu&#383;t in&#383;i&#383;t that a heartle&#383;s
conduct is the contrary of virtuous.
Truth is the only ba&#383;is of virtue; and
we cannot, without depraving our
minds, endeavour to plea&#383;e a lover or
hu&#383;band, but in proportion as he
plea&#383;es us. Men, more effectually to
en&#383;lave us, may inculcate this partial
morality, and lo&#383;e &#383;ight of virtue in
&#383;ubdividing it into the duties of particular
&#383;tations; but let us not blu&#383;h for
nature without a cau&#383;e!</p>

<p>"After the&#383;e remarks, I am a&#383;hamed
to own, that I was pregnant. The
greate&#383;t &#383;acrifice of my principles in my
whole life, was the allowing my hu&#383;band
again to be familiar with my per&#383;on,
though to this cruel act of &#383;elf-denial,
when I wi&#383;hed the earth to
open and &#383;wallow me, you owe your
birth; and I the unutterable plea&#383;ure<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-32_S" id="BPg_2-32_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-32.png">32</a>]</span>
of being a mother. There was &#383;omething
of delicacy in my hu&#383;band's bridal
attentions; but now his tainted breath,
pimpled face, and blood-&#383;hot eyes,
were not more repugnant to my &#383;en&#383;es,
than his gro&#383;s manners, and lovele&#383;s
familiarity to my ta&#383;te.</p>

<p>"A man would only be expected to
maintain; yes, barely grant a &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence,
to a woman rendered odious by
habitual intoxication; but who would
expect him, or think it po&#383;&#383;ible to love
her? And unle&#383;s 'youth, and genial
years were flown,' it would be thought
equally unrea&#383;onable to in&#383;i&#383;t, [under
penalty of] forfeiting almo&#383;t every thing
reckoned valuable in life, that he
&#383;hould not love another: whil&#383;t woman,
weak in rea&#383;on, impotent in will,
is required to moralize, &#383;entimentalize
her&#383;elf to &#383;tone, and pine her life away,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-33_S" id="BPg_2-33_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-33.png">33</a>]</span>
labouring to reform her embruted
mate. He may even &#383;pend in di&#383;&#383;ipation,
and intemperance, the very intemperance
which renders him &#383;o hateful,
her property, and by &#383;tinting her
expences, not permit her to beguile in
&#383;ociety, a weari&#383;ome, joyle&#383;s life; for
over their mutual fortune &#383;he has no
power, it mu&#383;t all pa&#383;s through his
hand. And if &#383;he be a mother, and
in the pre&#383;ent &#383;tate of women, it is a
great mi&#383;fortune to be prevented from
di&#383;charging the duties, and cultivating
the affections of one, what has &#383;he not
to endure?&mdash;But I have &#383;uffered the
tenderne&#383;s of one to lead me into reflections
that I did not think of making,
to interrupt my narrative&mdash;yet the full
heart will overflow.</p>

<p>"Mr. Venables' embarra&#383;&#383;ments did
not now endear him to me; &#383;till, anxi<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-34_S" id="BPg_2-34_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-34.png">34</a>]</span>ous
to befriend him, I endeavoured to
prevail on him to retrench his expences;
but he had always &#383;ome plau&#383;ible
excu&#383;e to give, to ju&#383;tify his not
following my advice. Humanity, compa&#383;&#383;ion,
and the intere&#383;t produced by a
habit of living together, made me try
to relieve, and &#383;ympathize with him;
but, when I recollected that I was
bound to live with &#383;uch a being for
ever&mdash;my heart died within me; my
de&#383;ire of improvement became languid,
and baleful, corroding melancholy took
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of my &#383;oul. Marriage had
ba&#383;tilled me for life. I di&#383;covered in
my&#383;elf a capacity for the enjoyment of
the various plea&#383;ures exi&#383;tence affords;
yet, fettered by the partial laws of &#383;ociety,
this fair globe was to me an
univer&#383;al blank.</p>

<p>"When I exhorted my hu&#383;band to<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-35_S" id="BPg_2-35_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-35.png">35</a>]</span>
economy, I referred to him&#383;elf. I was
obliged to practi&#383;e the mo&#383;t rigid, or
contract debts, which I had too much
rea&#383;on to fear would never be paid. I
de&#383;pi&#383;ed this paltry privilege of a wife,
which can only be of u&#383;e to the vicious
or incon&#383;iderate, and determined not to
increa&#383;e the torrent that was bearing
him down. I was then ignorant of
the extent of his fraudulent &#383;peculations,
whom I was bound to honour
and obey.</p>

<p>"A woman neglected by her hu&#383;band,
or who&#383;e manners form a &#383;triking
contra&#383;t with his, will always have
men on the watch to &#383;oothe and flatter
her. Be&#383;ides, the forlorn &#383;tate of a
neglected woman, not de&#383;titute of per&#383;onal
charms, is particularly intere&#383;ting,
and rou&#383;es that &#383;pecies of pity,
which is &#383;o near akin, it ea&#383;ily &#383;lides<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-36_S" id="BPg_2-36_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-36.png">36</a>]</span>
into love. A man of feeling thinks
not of &#383;educing, he is him&#383;elf &#383;educed

He figures to him&#383;elf all the &#383;acrifices a
woman of &#383;en&#383;ibility mu&#383;t make, and
every &#383;ituation in which his imagination
places her, touches his heart,
and fires his pa&#383;&#383;ions. Longing to
take to his bo&#383;om the &#383;horn lamb, and
bid the drooping buds of hope revive,
benevolence changes into pa&#383;&#383;ion:
and &#383;hould he then di&#383;cover that he is
beloved, honour binds him fa&#383;t, though
fore&#383;eeing that he may afterwards be
obliged to pay &#383;evere damages to the
man, who never appeared to value his
wife's &#383;ociety, till he found that there
was a chance of his being indemnified
for the lo&#383;s of it.</p>

<p>"Such are the partial laws enacted
by men; for, only to lay a &#383;tre&#383;s on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-37_S" id="BPg_2-37_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-37.png">37</a>]</span>
dependent &#383;tate of a woman in the
grand que&#383;tion of the comforts ari&#383;ing
from the po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of property, &#383;he is
[even in this article] much more injured
by the lo&#383;s of the hu&#383;band's affection,
than he by that of his wife; yet where
is &#383;he, condemned to the &#383;olitude of a
de&#383;erted home, to look for a compen&#383;ation
from the woman, who &#383;educes
him from her? She cannot drive an
unfaithful hu&#383;band from his hou&#383;e, nor
&#383;eparate, or tear, his children from
him, however culpable he may be; and
he, &#383;till the ma&#383;ter of his own fate, enjoys
the &#383;miles of a world, that would
brand her with infamy, did &#383;he, &#383;eeking
con&#383;olation, venture to retaliate.</p>

<p>"The&#383;e remarks are not dictated by
experience; but merely by the compa&#383;&#383;ion
I feel for many amiable women,
the <i>out-laws</i> of the world. For my<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-38_S" id="BPg_2-38_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-38.png">38</a>]</span>&#383;elf,
never encouraging any of the advances
that were made to me, my lovers
dropped off like the untimely &#383;hoots of
&#383;pring. I did not even coquet with
them; becau&#383;e I found, on examining
my&#383;elf, I could not coquet with a man
without loving him a little; and I perceived
that I &#383;hould not be able to
&#383;top at the line of what are termed <i>innocent
freedoms</i>, did I &#383;uffer any. My
re&#383;erve was then the con&#383;equence of
delicacy. Freedom of conduct has
emancipated many women's minds;
but my conduct has mo&#383;t rigidly been
governed by my principles, till the improvement
of my under&#383;tanding has
enabled me to di&#383;cern the fallacy of
prejudices at war with nature and
rea&#383;on.</p>

<p>"Shortly after the change I have
mentioned in my hu&#383;band's conduct,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-39_S" id="BPg_2-39_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-39.png">39</a>]</span>
my uncle was compelled by his declining
health, to &#383;eek the &#383;uccour of a
milder climate, and embark for Li&#383;bon.
He left his will in the hands of a friend,
an eminent &#383;olicitor; he had previou&#383;ly
que&#383;tioned me relative to my &#383;ituation
and &#383;tate of mind, and declared very
freely, that he could place no reliance
on the &#383;tability of my hu&#383;band's profe&#383;&#383;ions.
He had been deceived in the
unfolding of his character; he now
thought it fixed in a train of actions
that would inevitably lead to ruin and
di&#383;grace.</p>

<p>"The evening before his departure,
which we &#383;pent alone together, he
folded me to his heart, uttering the endearing
appellation of 'child.'&mdash;My
more than father! why was I not permitted
to perform the la&#383;t duties of
one, and &#383;mooth the pillow of death?<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-40_S" id="BPg_2-40_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-40.png">40</a>]</span>
He &#383;eemed by his manner to be convinced
that he &#383;hould never &#383;ee me
more; yet reque&#383;ted me, mo&#383;t earne&#383;tly,
to come to him, &#383;hould I be obliged to
leave my hu&#383;band. He had before expre&#383;&#383;ed
his &#383;orrow at hearing of my
pregnancy, having determined to prevail
on me to accompany him, till I
informed him of that circum&#383;tance. He
expre&#383;&#383;ed him&#383;elf unfeignedly &#383;orry that
any new tie &#383;hould bind me to a man
whom he thought &#383;o incapable of e&#383;timating
my value; &#383;uch was the kind
language of affection.</p>

<p>"I mu&#383;t repeat his own words; they
made an indelible impre&#383;&#383;ion on my
mind:</p>

<p>"'The marriage &#383;tate is certainly that
in which women, generally &#383;peaking,
can be mo&#383;t u&#383;eful; but I am far from
thinking that a woman, once married,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-41_S" id="BPg_2-41_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-41.png">41</a>]</span>
ought to con&#383;ider the engagement as
indi&#383;&#383;oluble (e&#383;pecially if there be no
children to reward her for &#383;acrificing
her feelings) in ca&#383;e her hu&#383;band
merits neither her love, nor e&#383;teem.
E&#383;teem will often &#383;upply the place of
love; and prevent a woman from being
wretched, though it may not
make her happy. The magnitude of
a &#383;acrifice ought always to bear &#383;ome
proportion to the utility in view;
and for a woman to live with a man,
for whom &#383;he can cheri&#383;h neither affection
nor e&#383;teem, or even be of any
u&#383;e to him, excepting in the light of
a hou&#383;e-keeper, is an abjectne&#383;s of
condition, the enduring of which no
concurrence of circum&#383;tances can
ever make a duty in the &#383;ight of God
or ju&#383;t men. If indeed &#383;he &#383;ubmits to
it merely to be maintained in idlene&#383;s,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-42_S" id="BPg_2-42_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-42.png">42</a>]</span>
&#383;he has no right to complain bitterly
of her fate; or to act, as a per&#383;on of
independent character might, as if
&#383;he had a title to di&#383;regard general
rules.</p>

<p>"<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added mi&#383;&#383;ing quotation mark">'</ins>But the mi&#383;fortune is, that many
women only &#383;ubmit in appearance,
and forfeit their own re&#383;pect to &#383;ecure
their reputation in the world. The
&#383;ituation of a woman &#383;eparated from
her hu&#383;band, is undoubtedly very different
from that of a man who has
left his wife. He, with lordly dignity,
has &#383;haken of a clog; and the allowing
her food and raiment, is
thought &#383;ufficient to &#383;ecure his reputation
from taint. And, &#383;hould &#383;he

he never was &#383;o, but in name) is

the independence of mind di&#383;tinctive
of a rational being, and &#383;purning at
&#383;lavery.'</p>

<p>"During the remainder of the evening,
my uncle's tenderne&#383;s led him frequently
to revert to the &#383;ubject, and
utter, with increa&#383;ing warmth, &#383;entiments
to the &#383;ame purport. At length
it was nece&#383;&#383;ary to &#383;ay 'Farewell!'&mdash;and

<h2><a name="BCHAP_XI_S" id="BCHAP_XI_S"></a>CHAP. XI.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">A gentleman</span> of large fortune
and of poli&#383;hed manners, had lately
vi&#383;ited very frequently at our hou&#383;e,
and treated me, if po&#383;&#383;ible, with more
re&#383;pect than Mr. Venables paid him;
my pregnancy was not yet vi&#383;ible,
his &#383;ociety was a great relief to me, as
I had for &#383;ome time pa&#383;t, to avoid expence,
confined my&#383;elf very much at
home. I ever di&#383;dained unnece&#383;&#383;ary,
perhaps even prudent concealments;
and my hu&#383;band, with great ea&#383;e, di&#383;covered
the amount of my uncle's parting
pre&#383;ent. A copy of a writ was the
&#383;tale pretext to extort it from me; and
I had &#383;oon rea&#383;on to believe that it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-45_S" id="BPg_2-45_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-45.png">45</a>]</span>
fabricated for the purpo&#383;e. I acknowledge
my folly in thus &#383;uffering my&#383;elf
to be continually impo&#383;ed on. I had
adhered to my re&#383;olution not to apply
to my uncle, on the part of my hu&#383;band,
any more; yet, when I had received
a &#383;um &#383;ufficient to &#383;upply my own
wants, and to enable me to pur&#383;ue a
plan I had in view, to &#383;ettle my younger
brother in a re&#383;pectable employment,
I allowed my&#383;elf to be duped by
Mr. Venables' &#383;hallow pretences, and
hypocritical profe&#383;&#383;ions.</p>

<p>"Thus did he pillage me and my
family, thus fru&#383;trate all my plans of
u&#383;efulne&#383;s. Yet this was the man I was
bound to re&#383;pect and e&#383;teem: as if re&#383;pect
and e&#383;teem depended on an arbitrary
will of our own! But a wife being
as much a man's property as his
hor&#383;e, or his a&#383;s, &#383;he has nothing &#383;he<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-46_S" id="BPg_2-46_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-46.png">46</a>]</span>
can call her own. He may u&#383;e any
means to get at what the law con&#383;iders
as his, the moment his wife is in
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of it, even to the forcing of
a lock, as Mr. Venables did, to &#383;earch
for notes in my writing-de&#383;k&mdash;and all
this is done with a &#383;how of equity, becau&#383;e,
for&#383;ooth, he is re&#383;pon&#383;ible for
her maintenance.</p>

<p>"The tender mother cannot <i>lawfully</i>
&#383;natch from the gripe of the
gambling &#383;pendthrift, or bea&#383;tly
drunkard, unmindful of his off&#383;pring,
the fortune which falls to her by
chance; or (&#383;o flagrant is the inju&#383;tice)
what &#383;he earns by her own exertions.
No; he can rob her with impunity,
even to wa&#383;te publicly on a courtezan;
and the laws of her country&mdash;if women
have a country&mdash;afford her no protection
or redre&#383;s from the oppre&#383;&#383;or, un<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-47_S" id="BPg_2-47_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-47.png">47</a>]</span>le&#383;s
&#383;he have the plea of bodily fear;
yet how many ways are there of goading
the &#383;oul almo&#383;t to madne&#383;s, equally
unmanly, though not &#383;o mean? When
&#383;uch laws were framed, &#383;hould not
impartial lawgivers have fir&#383;t decreed,
in the &#383;tyle of a great a&#383;&#383;embly, who recognized
the exi&#383;tence of an <i>&ecirc;tre &#383;upr&ecirc;me</i>,
to fix the national belief, that
the hu&#383;band &#383;hould always be wi&#383;er and
more virtuous than his wife, in order
to entitle him, with a &#383;how of ju&#383;tice,
to keep this idiot, or perpetual minor,
for ever in bondage. But I mu&#383;t have
done&mdash;on this &#383;ubject, my indignation
continually runs away with me.</p>

<p>"The company of the gentleman I
have already mentioned, who had a
general acquaintance with literature
and &#383;ubjects of ta&#383;te, was grateful to
me; my countenance brightened up as<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-48_S" id="BPg_2-48_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-48.png">48</a>]</span>
he approached, and I unaffectedly
expre&#383;&#383;ed the plea&#383;ure I felt. The
amu&#383;ement his conver&#383;ation afforded
me, made it ea&#383;y to comply with my
hu&#383;band's reque&#383;t, to endeavour to render
our hou&#383;e agreeable to him.</p>

<p>"His attentions became more
pointed; but, as I was not of the
number of women, who&#383;e virtue, as
it is termed, immediately takes alarm,
I endeavoured, rather by raillery than
&#383;erious expo&#383;tulation, to give a different
turn to his conver&#383;ation. He a&#383;&#383;umed a
new mode of attack, and I was, for a
while, the dupe of his pretended
friend&#383;hip.</p>

<p>"I had, merely in the &#383;tyle of <i>badinage</i>,
boa&#383;ted of my conque&#383;t, and repeated
his lover-like compliments to
my hu&#383;band. But he begged me, for
God's &#383;ake, not to affront his friend, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-49_S" id="BPg_2-49_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-49.png">49</a>]</span>
I &#383;hould de&#383;troy all his projects, and be
his ruin. Had I had more affection for
my hu&#383;band, I &#383;hould have expre&#383;&#383;ed
my contempt of this time-&#383;erving politene&#383;s:
now I imagined that I only
felt pity; yet it would have puzzled a
ca&#383;ui&#383;t to point out in what the exact
difference con&#383;i&#383;ted.</p>

<p>"This friend began now, in confidence,
to di&#383;cover to me the real &#383;tate
of my hu&#383;band's affairs. 'Nece&#383;&#383;ity,'
&#383;aid Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;; why &#383;hould I reveal
his name? for he affected to palliate the
conduct he could not excu&#383;e, 'had
led him to take &#383;uch &#383;teps, by accommodation
bills, buying goods on credit,
to &#383;ell them for ready money, and &#383;imilar
tran&#383;actions, that his character in
the commercial world was gone. He
was con&#383;idered,' he added, lowering
his voice, 'on 'Change as a &#383;windler.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-50_S" id="BPg_2-50_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-50.png">50</a>]</span>
"I felt at that moment the fir&#383;t maternal
pang. Aware of the evils my
&#383;ex have to &#383;truggle with, I &#383;till wi&#383;hed,
for my own con&#383;olation, to be the mother
of a daughter; and I could not
bear to think, that the <i>&#383;ins</i> of her father's
entailed di&#383;grace, &#383;hould be added
to the ills to which woman is heir.</p>

<p>"So completely was I deceived by
the&#383;e &#383;hows of friend&#383;hip (nay, I believe,
according to his interpretation, Mr. S&mdash;
really was my friend) that I began
to con&#383;ult him re&#383;pecting the be&#383;t mode
of retrieving my hu&#383;band's character:
it is the good name of a woman only
that &#383;ets to ri&#383;e no more. I knew
not that he had been drawn into a
whirlpool, out of which he had not
the energy to attempt to e&#383;cape. He
&#383;eemed indeed de&#383;titute of the power
of employing his faculties in any regu<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-51_S" id="BPg_2-51_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-51.png">51</a>]</span>lar
pur&#383;uit. His principles of action
were &#383;o loo&#383;e, and his mind &#383;o uncultivated,
that every thing like order appeared
to him in the &#383;hape of re&#383;traint;
and, like men in the &#383;avage &#383;tate, he
required the &#383;trong &#383;timulus of hope
or fear, produced by wild &#383;peculations,
in which the intere&#383;ts of others went
for nothing, to keep his &#383;pirits awake.
He one time po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed patrioti&#383;m, but
he knew not what it was to feel hone&#383;t
indignation; and pretended to be an advocate
for liberty, when, with as little
affection for the human race as for individuals,
he thought of nothing but
his own gratification. He was ju&#383;t
&#383;uch a citizen, as a father. The &#383;ums
he adroitly obtained by a violation of
the laws of his country, as well as
tho&#383;e of humanity, he would allow a
mi&#383;tre&#383;s to &#383;quander; though &#383;he was,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-52_S" id="BPg_2-52_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-52.png">52</a>]</span>
with the &#383;ame <i>&#383;ang froid</i>, con&#383;igned, as
were his children, to poverty, when
another proved more attractive.</p>

<p>"On various pretences, his friend
continued to vi&#383;it me; and, ob&#383;erving
my want of money, he tried to induce
me to accept of pecuniary aid; but this
offer I ab&#383;olutely rejected, though it
was made with &#383;uch delicacy, I could
not be di&#383;plea&#383;ed.</p>

<p>"One day he came, as I thought
accidentally, to dinner. My hu&#383;band
was very much engaged in bu&#383;ine&#383;s,
and quitted the room &#383;oon after the
cloth was removed. We conver&#383;ed as
u&#383;ual, till confidential advice led again
to love. I was extremely mortified.
I had a &#383;incere regard for him, and
hoped that he had an equal friend&#383;hip
for me. I therefore began mildly to
expo&#383;tulate with him. This gentle<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-53_S" id="BPg_2-53_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-53.png">53</a>]</span>ne&#383;s
he mi&#383;took for coy encouragement;
and he would not be diverted
from the &#383;ubject. Perceiving his mi&#383;take,
I &#383;eriou&#383;ly a&#383;ked him how, u&#383;ing
&#383;uch language to me, he could profe&#383;s
to be my hu&#383;band's friend? A &#383;ignificant
&#383;neer excited my curio&#383;ity, and he,
&#383;uppo&#383;ing this to be my only &#383;cruple,
took a letter deliberately out of his
pocket, &#383;aying, 'Your hu&#383;band's honour
is not inflexible. How could you,
with your di&#383;cernment, think it &#383;o?
Why, he left the room this very day
on purpo&#383;e to give me an opportunity
to explain my&#383;elf; <i>he</i> thought me too
timid&mdash;too tardy.<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added mi&#383;&#383;ing quotation mark">'</ins></p>

<p>"I &#383;natched the letter with inde&#383;cribable
emotion. The purport of it
was to invite him to dinner, and to ridicule
his chivalrous re&#383;pect for me.
He a&#383;&#383;ured him, 'that every woman had<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-54_S" id="BPg_2-54_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-54.png">54</a>]</span>
her price, and, with gro&#383;s indecency,
hinted, that he &#383;hould be glad to have
the duty of a hu&#383;band taken off his
hands. The&#383;e he termed <i>liberal &#383;entiments</i>.
He advi&#383;ed him not to &#383;hock my
romantic notions, but to attack my
credulous genero&#383;ity, and weak pity;
and concluded with reque&#383;ting him to
lend him five hundred pounds for a
month or &#383;ix weeks.' I read this letter
twice over; and the firm purpo&#383;e it in&#383;pired,
calmed the ri&#383;ing tumult of my
&#383;oul. I ro&#383;e deliberately, reque&#383;ted
Mr. S&mdash;&mdash; to wait a moment, and in&#383;tantly
going into the counting-hou&#383;e,
de&#383;ired Mr. Venables to return with me
to the dining-parlour.</p>

<p>"He laid down his pen, and entered
with me, without ob&#383;erving any change
in my countenance. I &#383;hut the door,
and, giving him the letter, &#383;imply<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-55_S" id="BPg_2-55_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-55.png">55</a>]</span>
a&#383;ked, 'whether he wrote it, or was it
a forgery?'</p>

<p>"Nothing could equal his confu&#383;ion.
His friend's eye met his, and
he muttered &#383;omething about a joke&mdash;But
I interrupted him&mdash;'It is &#383;ufficient&mdash;We
part for ever.'</p>

<p>"I continued, with &#383;olemnity, 'I
have borne with your tyranny and infidelities.
I di&#383;dain to utter what I
have borne with. I thought you unprincipled,
but not &#383;o decidedly
vicious. I formed a tie, in the &#383;ight of
heaven&mdash;I have held it &#383;acred; even
when men, more conformable to my

love. Neglected by you, I have re&#383;olutely
&#383;tifled the enticing emotions, and
re&#383;pected the plighted faith you outraged.
And you dare now to in&#383;ult<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-56_S" id="BPg_2-56_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-56.png">56</a>]</span>
me, by &#383;elling me to pro&#383;titution!&mdash;Yes&mdash;equally
lo&#383;t to delicacy and principle&mdash;you
dared &#383;acrilegiou&#383;ly to barter
the honour of the mother of your
child.'</p>

<p>"Then, turning to Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;, I
added, 'I call on you, Sir, to witne&#383;s,'
and I lifted my hands and eyes to heaven,
'that, as &#383;olemnly as I took his
name, I now abjure it,' I pulled off my
ring, and put it on the table; 'and that
I mean immediately to quit his hou&#383;e,
never to enter it more. I will provide
for my&#383;elf and child. I leave him as
free as I am determined to be my&#383;elf&mdash;he
&#383;hall be an&#383;werable for no debts of
mine.'</p>

<p>"A&#383;toni&#383;hment clo&#383;ed their lips, till
Mr. Venables, gently pu&#383;hing his
friend, with a forced &#383;mile, out of the
room, nature for a moment prevailed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-57_S" id="BPg_2-57_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-57.png">57</a>]</span>
and, appearing like him&#383;elf, he turned
round, burning with rage, to me:
but there was no terror in the frown,
excepting when contra&#383;ted with the
malignant &#383;mile which preceded it.
He bade me 'leave the hou&#383;e at my
peril; told me he de&#383;pi&#383;ed my threats;
I had no re&#383;ource; I could not &#383;wear the
peace again&#383;t him!&mdash;I was not afraid of
my life!&mdash;he had never &#383;truck me!'</p>

<p>"He threw the letter in the fire,
which I had incautiou&#383;ly left in his
hands; and, quitting the room, locked
the door on me.</p>

<p>"When left alone, I was a moment
or two before I could recollect my&#383;elf.
One &#383;cene had &#383;ucceeded another with
&#383;uch rapidity, I almo&#383;t doubted whether
I was reflecting on a real event.
'Was it po&#383;&#383;ible? Was I, indeed,
free?'&mdash;Yes; free I termed my&#383;elf,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-58_S" id="BPg_2-58_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-58.png">58</a>]</span>
when I decidedly perceived the conduct
I ought to adopt. How had I panted
for liberty&mdash;liberty, that I would have
purcha&#383;ed at any price, but that of my
own e&#383;teem! I ro&#383;e, and &#383;hook my&#383;elf;
opened the window, and methought
the air never &#383;melled &#383;o &#383;weet. The face
of heaven grew fairer as I viewed it,
and the clouds &#383;eemed to flit away obedient
to my wi&#383;hes, to give my &#383;oul
room to expand. I was all &#383;oul, and
(wild as it may appear) felt as if I
could have di&#383;&#383;olved in the &#383;oft balmy
gale that ki&#383;&#383;ed my cheek, or have
glided below the horizon on the glowing,
de&#383;cending beams. A &#383;eraphic &#383;ati&#383;faction
animated, without agitating
my &#383;pirits; and my imagination collected,
in vi&#383;ions &#383;ublimely terrible, or
&#383;oothingly beautiful, an immen&#383;e variety
of the endle&#383;s images, which nature<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-59_S" id="BPg_2-59_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-59.png">59</a>]</span>
affords, and fancy combines, of the
grand and fair. The lu&#383;tre of the&#383;e
bright picture&#383;que &#383;ketches faded with
the &#383;etting &#383;un; but I was &#383;till alive to
the calm delight they had diffu&#383;ed
through my heart.</p>

<p>"There may be advocates for matrimonial
obedience, who, making a di&#383;tinction
between the duty of a wife and
of a human being, may blame my conduct.&mdash;To
them I write not&mdash;my feelings
are not for them to analyze; and
may you, my child, never be able to
a&#383;certain, by heart-rending experience,
what your mother felt before the pre&#383;ent
emancipation of her mind!</p>

<p>"I began to write a letter to my father,
after clo&#383;ing one to my uncle;
not to a&#383;k advice, but to &#383;ignify my determination;
when I was interrupted
by the entrance of Mr. Venables. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-60_S" id="BPg_2-60_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-60.png">60</a>]</span>
manner was changed. His views on
my uncle's fortune made him aver&#383;e to
my quitting his hou&#383;e, or he would, I
am convinced, have been glad to have
&#383;haken off even the &#383;light re&#383;traint my
pre&#383;ence impo&#383;ed on him; the re&#383;traint
of &#383;howing me &#383;ome re&#383;pect. So far
from having an affection for me, he
really hated me, becau&#383;e he was convinced
that I mu&#383;t de&#383;pi&#383;e him.</p>

<p>"He told me, that, 'As I now had
had time to cool and reflect, he did not
doubt but that my prudence, and nice
&#383;en&#383;e of propriety, would lead me to
overlook what was pa&#383;&#383;ed.'</p>

<p>"'Reflection,' I replied, 'had only
confirmed my purpo&#383;e, and no power
on earth could divert me from it.'</p>

<p>"Endeavouring to a&#383;&#383;ume a &#383;oothing
voice and look, when he would willingly
have tortured me, to force me to<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-61_S" id="BPg_2-61_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-61.png">61</a>]</span>
feel his power, his countenance had an
infernal expre&#383;&#383;ion, when he de&#383;ired me,
'Not to expo&#383;e my&#383;elf to the &#383;ervants,
by obliging him to confine me in my
apartment; if then I would give my
promi&#383;e not to quit the hou&#383;e precipitately,
I &#383;hould be free&mdash;and&mdash;.' I declared,
interrupting him, 'that I would
promi&#383;e nothing. I had no mea&#383;ures
to keep with him&mdash;I was re&#383;olved, and
would not conde&#383;cend to &#383;ubterfuge.'</p>

<p>"He muttered, 'that I &#383;hould &#383;oon
repent of the&#383;e prepo&#383;terous airs;' and,
ordering tea to be carried into my little
&#383;tudy, which had a communication with
my bed-chamber, he once more locked
the door upon me, and left me to my
own meditations. I had pa&#383;&#383;ively followed
him up &#383;tairs, not wi&#383;hing to fatigue
my&#383;elf with unavailing exertion.</p>

<p>"Nothing calms the mind like a<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-62_S" id="BPg_2-62_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-62.png">62</a>]</span>
fixed purpo&#383;e. I felt as if I had heaved
a thou&#383;and weight from my heart; the
atmo&#383;phere &#383;eemed lightened; and, if
I execrated the in&#383;titutions of &#383;ociety,
which thus enable men to tyrannize
over women, it was almo&#383;t a di&#383;intere&#383;ted
&#383;entiment. I di&#383;regarded pre&#383;ent
inconveniences, when my mind had
done &#383;truggling with it&#383;elf,&mdash;when rea&#383;on
and inclination had &#383;haken hands
and were at peace. I had no longer
the cruel ta&#383;k before me, in endle&#383;s per&#383;pective,
aye, during the tedious
for ever of life, of labouring to
overcome my repugnance&mdash;of labouring
to extingui&#383;h the hopes, the maybes
of a lively imagination. Death I
had hailed as my only chance for deliverance;
but, while exi&#383;tence had &#383;till
&#383;o many charms, and life promi&#383;ed
happine&#383;s, I &#383;hrunk from the icy arms<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-63_S" id="BPg_2-63_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-63.png">63</a>]</span>
of an unknown tyrant, though far more
inviting than tho&#383;e of the man, to whom I
&#383;uppo&#383;ed my&#383;elf bound without any other
alternative; and was content to linger
a little longer, waiting for I knew not
what, rather than leave 'the warm
precincts of the cheerful day,' and all
the unenjoyed affection of my nature.</p>

<p>"My pre&#383;ent &#383;ituation gave a new
turn to my reflection; and I wondered
(now the film &#383;eemed to be withdrawn,
that ob&#383;cured the piercing &#383;ight of rea&#383;on)
how I could, previou&#383;ly to the deciding
outrage, have con&#383;idered my&#383;elf
as everla&#383;tingly united to vice and folly?
'Had an evil genius ca&#383;t a &#383;pell at my
birth; or a demon &#383;talked out of chaos,
to perplex my under&#383;tanding, and enchain
my will, with delu&#383;ive prejudices?'</p>

<p>"I pur&#383;ued this train of thinking; it<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-64_S" id="BPg_2-64_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-64.png">64</a>]</span>
led me out of my&#383;elf, to expatiate on
the mi&#383;ery peculiar to my &#383;ex. 'Are
not,' I thought, 'the de&#383;pots for ever
&#383;tigmatized, who, in the wantonne&#383;s of
power, commanded even the mo&#383;t atrocious
criminals to be chained to dead
bodies? though &#383;urely tho&#383;e laws are
much more inhuman, which forge adamantine
fetters to bind minds together,
that never can mingle in &#383;ocial communion!
What indeed can equal the
wretchedne&#383;s of that &#383;tate, in which
there is no alternative, but to extingui&#383;h
the affections, or encounter infamy?'</p>

<h2><a name="BCHAP_XII_S" id="BCHAP_XII_S"></a>CHAP. XII.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Towards</span> midnight Mr. Venables
entered my chamber; and, with
calm audacity preparing to go to bed,
he bade me make ha&#383;te, 'for that was
the be&#383;t place for hu&#383;bands and wives
to end their differences. He had been
drinking plentifully to aid his courage.</p>

<p>"I did not at fir&#383;t deign to reply.
But perceiving that he affected to take
my &#383;ilence for con&#383;ent, I told him that,
'If he would not go to another bed, or
allow me, I &#383;hould &#383;it up in my &#383;tudy
all night.' He attempted to pull me
into the chamber, half joking. But I
re&#383;i&#383;ted; and, as he had determined not
to give me any rea&#383;on for &#383;aying that
he u&#383;ed violence, after a few more ef<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-66_S" id="BPg_2-66_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-66.png">66</a>]</span>forts,
he retired, cur&#383;ing my ob&#383;tinacy,
to bed.</p>

<p>"I &#383;at mu&#383;ing &#383;ome time longer; then,
throwing my cloak around me, prepared
for &#383;leep on a &#383;opha. And, &#383;o fortunate
&#383;eemed my deliverance, &#383;o &#383;acred
the plea&#383;ure of being thus wrapped up
in my&#383;elf, that I &#383;lept profoundly, and
woke with a mind compo&#383;ed to encounter
the &#383;truggles of the day. Mr.
Venables did not wake till &#383;ome hours
after; and then he came to me half-dre&#383;&#383;ed,
yawning and &#383;tretching, with
haggard eyes, as if he &#383;carcely recollected
what had pa&#383;&#383;ed the preceding
evening. He fixed his eyes on me for
a moment, then, calling me a fool,
a&#383;ked 'How long I intended to continue
this pretty farce? For his part, he
was devili&#383;h &#383;ick of it; but this was the
plague of marrying women who pretended
to know &#383;omething.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-67_S" id="BPg_2-67_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-67.png">67</a>]</span>
"I made no other reply to this harangue,
than to &#383;ay, 'That he ought to
be glad to get rid of a woman &#383;o unfit
to be his companion&mdash;and that any
change in my conduct would be mean
di&#383;&#383;imulation; for maturer reflection
only gave the &#383;acred &#383;eal of rea&#383;on to
my fir&#383;t re&#383;olution.'</p>

<p>"He looked as if he could have
&#383;tamped with impatience, at being
obliged to &#383;tifle his rage; but, conquering
his anger (for weak people, who&#383;e
pa&#383;&#383;ions &#383;eem the mo&#383;t ungovernable,
re&#383;train them with the greate&#383;t ea&#383;e,
when they have a &#383;ufficient motive), he
exclaimed, 'Very pretty, upon my
&#383;oul! very pretty, theatrical flouri&#383;hes!
Pray, fair Roxana, &#383;toop from your altitudes,
and remember that you are
acting a part in real life.'</p>

<p>"He uttered this &#383;peech with a &#383;elf-<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-68_S" id="BPg_2-68_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-68.png">68</a>]</span>&#383;ati&#383;fied
air, and went down &#383;tairs to
dre&#383;s.</p>

<p>"In about an hour he came to me
again; and in the &#383;ame tone &#383;aid, 'That
he came as my gentleman-u&#383;her to hand
me down to breakfa&#383;t.</p>

<p>"'Of the black rod?' a&#383;ked I.</p>

<p>"This que&#383;tion, and the tone in
which I a&#383;ked it, a little di&#383;concerted
him. To &#383;ay the truth, I now felt no
re&#383;entment; my firm re&#383;olution to free
my&#383;elf from my ignoble thraldom, had
ab&#383;orbed the various emotions which,
during &#383;ix years, had racked my &#383;oul.
The duty pointed out by my principles
&#383;eemed clear; and not one tender feeling
intruded to make me &#383;werve: The
di&#383;like which my hu&#383;band had in&#383;pired
was &#383;trong; but it only led me to wi&#383;h
to avoid, to wi&#383;h to let him drop out of
my memory; there was no mi&#383;ery, no<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-69_S" id="BPg_2-69_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-69.png">69</a>]</span>
torture that I would not deliberately
have cho&#383;en, rather than renew my
lea&#383;e of &#383;ervitude.</p>

<p>"During the breakfa&#383;t, he attempted
to rea&#383;on with me on the folly of romantic
&#383;entiments; for this was the indi&#383;criminate
epithet he gave to every
mode of conduct or thinking &#383;uperior
to his own. He a&#383;&#383;erted, 'that all the
world were governed by their own intere&#383;t;
tho&#383;e who pretended to be actuated
by different motives, were only
deeper knaves, or fools crazed by books,
who took for go&#383;pel all the rodomantade
non&#383;en&#383;e written by men who
knew nothing of the world. For his
part, he thanked God, he was no hypocrite;
and, if he &#383;tretched a point
&#383;ometimes, it was always with an intention
of paying every man his own.'</p>

<p>"He then artfully in&#383;inuated, 'that<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-70_S" id="BPg_2-70_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-70.png">70</a>]</span>
he daily expected a ve&#383;&#383;el to arrive, a
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful &#383;peculation, that would make
him ea&#383;y for the pre&#383;ent, and that he
had &#383;everal other &#383;chemes actually depending,
that could not fail. He had
no doubt of becoming rich in a few
years, though he had been thrown back
by &#383;ome unlucky adventures at the &#383;etting
out.'</p>

<p>"I mildly replied, 'That I wi&#383;hed he
might not involve him&#383;elf &#383;till deeper.'</p>

<p>"He had no notion that I was governed
by a deci&#383;ion of judgment, not
to be compared with a mere &#383;purt of
re&#383;entment. He knew not what it was
to feel indignation again&#383;t vice, and
often boa&#383;ted of his placable temper,
and readine&#383;s to forgive injuries. True;
for he only con&#383;idered the being deceived,
as an effort of &#383;kill he had not
guarded again&#383;t; and then, with a cant<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-71_S" id="BPg_2-71_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-71.png">71</a>]</span>
of candour, would ob&#383;erve, 'that he
did not know how he might him&#383;elf
have been tempted to act in the &#383;ame
circum&#383;tances.' And, as his heart
never opened to friend&#383;hip, it never was
wounded by di&#383;appointment. Every
new acquaintance he prote&#383;ted, it is
true, was 'the clevere&#383;t fellow in the
world;<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added mi&#383;&#383;ing quotation mark">'</ins> and he really thought &#383;o; till
the novelty of his conver&#383;ation or manners
cea&#383;ed to have any effect on his
&#383;luggi&#383;h &#383;pirits. His re&#383;pect for rank or
fortune was more permanent, though
he chanced to have no de&#383;ign of availing
him&#383;elf of the influence of either
to promote his own views.</p>

<p>"After a prefatory conver&#383;ation,&mdash;my
blood (I thought it had been cooler)
flu&#383;hed over my whole countenance as
he &#383;poke&mdash;he alluded to my &#383;ituation.
He de&#383;ired me to reflect&mdash;'and act like<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-72_S" id="BPg_2-72_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-72.png">72</a>]</span>
a prudent woman, as the be&#383;t proof of
my &#383;uperior under&#383;tanding; for he mu&#383;t
own I had &#383;en&#383;e, did I know how to
u&#383;e it. I was not,' he laid a &#383;tre&#383;s on
his words, 'without my pa&#383;&#383;ions; and
a hu&#383;band was a convenient cloke.&mdash;He
was liberal in his way of thinking;
and why might not we, like many other
married people, who were above vulgar
prejudices, tacitly con&#383;ent to let
each other follow their own inclination?&mdash;He
meant nothing more, in the
letter I made the ground of complaint;
and the plea&#383;ure which I &#383;eemed to
take in Mr. S.'s company, led him to
conclude, that he was not di&#383;agreeable
to me.'</p>

<p>"A clerk brought in the letters of
the day, and I, as I often did, while
he was di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ing &#383;ubjects of bu&#383;ine&#383;s,
went to the <i>piano forte</i>, and began to<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-73_S" id="BPg_2-73_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-73.png">73</a>]</span>
play a favourite air to re&#383;tore my&#383;elf,
as it were, to nature, and drive the
&#383;ophi&#383;ticated &#383;entiments I had ju&#383;t been
obliged to li&#383;ten to, out of my &#383;oul.</p>

<p>"They had excited &#383;en&#383;ations &#383;imilar
to tho&#383;e I have felt, in viewing the &#383;qualid
inhabitants of &#383;ome of the lanes and
back &#383;treets of the metropolis, mortified
at being compelled to con&#383;ider
them as my fellow-creatures, as if an
ape had claimed kindred with me. Or,
as when &#383;urrounded by a mephitical fog,
I have wi&#383;hed to have a volley of cannon
fired, to clear the incumbered atmo&#383;phere,
and give me room to breathe
and move.</p>

<p>"My &#383;pirits were all in arms, and I
played a kind of extemporary prelude.
The cadence was probably wild and
impa&#383;&#383;ioned, while, lo&#383;t in thought, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-74_S" id="BPg_2-74_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-74.png">74</a>]</span>
made the &#383;ounds a kind of echo to my
train of thinking.</p>

<p>"Pau&#383;ing for a moment, I met Mr.
Venables' eyes. He was ob&#383;erving me
with an air of conceited &#383;ati&#383;faction, as
much as to &#383;ay&mdash;'My la&#383;t in&#383;inuation
has done the bu&#383;ine&#383;s&mdash;&#383;he begins to
know her own intere&#383;t.' Then gathering
up his letters, he &#383;aid, 'That
he hoped he &#383;hould hear no more romantic
&#383;tuff, well enough in a mi&#383;s
ju&#383;t come from boarding &#383;chool;' and
went, as was his cu&#383;tom, to the counting-hou&#383;e.
I &#383;till continued playing;
and, turning to a &#383;prightly le&#383;&#383;on, I
executed it with uncommon vivacity.
I heard foot&#383;teps approach the door,
and was &#383;oon convinced that Mr. Venables
was li&#383;tening; the con&#383;ciou&#383;ne&#383;s
only gave more animation to my
fingers. He went down into the kit<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-75_S" id="BPg_2-75_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-75.png">75</a>]</span>chen,
and the cook, probably by his
de&#383;ire, came to me, to know what I
would plea&#383;e to order for dinner. Mr.
Venables came into the parlour again,
with apparent carele&#383;&#383;ne&#383;s. I perceived
that the cunning man was over-reaching
him&#383;elf; and I gave my directions
as u&#383;ual, and left the room.</p>

<p>"While I was making &#383;ome alteration
in my dre&#383;s, Mr. Venables peeped
in, and, begging my pardon for interrupting
me, di&#383;appeared. I took
up &#383;ome work (I could not read), and
two or three me&#383;&#383;ages were &#383;ent to me,
probably for no other purpo&#383;e, but to
enable Mr. Venables to a&#383;certain what
I was about.</p>

<p>"I li&#383;tened whenever I heard the
&#383;treet-door open; at la&#383;t I imagined I
could di&#383;tingui&#383;h Mr. Venables' &#383;tep,
going out. I laid a&#383;ide my work; my<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-76_S" id="BPg_2-76_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-76.png">76</a>]</span>
heart palpitated; &#383;till I was afraid
ha&#383;tily to enquire; and I waited a long
half hour, before I ventured to a&#383;k the
boy whether his ma&#383;ter was in the
counting-hou&#383;e?</p>

<p>"Being an&#383;wered in the negative,
I bade him call me a coach, and collecting
a few nece&#383;&#383;aries ha&#383;tily together,
with a little parcel of letters and
papers which I had collected the preceding
evening, I hurried into it, de&#383;iring
the coachman to drive to a di&#383;tant
part of the town.</p>

<p>"I almo&#383;t feared that the coach
would break down before I got out of
the &#383;treet; and, when I turned the
corner, I &#383;eemed to breathe a freer air.
I was ready to imagine that I was ri&#383;ing
above the thick atmo&#383;phere of earth;
or I felt, as wearied &#383;ouls might be &#383;up<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-77_S" id="BPg_2-77_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-77.png">77</a>]</span>po&#383;ed
to feel on entering another &#383;tate
of exi&#383;tence.</p>

<p>"I &#383;topped at one or two &#383;tands of
coaches to elude pur&#383;uit, and then
drove round the &#383;kirts of the town to
&#383;eek for an ob&#383;cure lodging, where I
wi&#383;hed to remain concealed, till I could
avail my&#383;elf of my uncle's protection.
I had re&#383;olved to a&#383;&#383;ume my own name
immediately, and openly to avow my
determination, without any formal vindication,
the moment I had found a
home, in which I could re&#383;t free from
the daily alarm of expecting to &#383;ee
Mr. Venables enter.</p>

<p>"I looked at &#383;everal lodgings; but
finding that I could not, without a reference
to &#383;ome acquaintance, who
might inform my tyrant, get admittance
into a decent apartment&mdash;men
have not all this trouble&mdash;I thought of<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-78_S" id="BPg_2-78_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-78.png">78</a>]</span>
a woman whom I had a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ted to furni&#383;h
a little haberda&#383;her's &#383;hop, and
who I knew had a fir&#383;t floor to let.</p>

<p>"I went to her, and though I could
not per&#383;uade her, that the quarrel between
me and Mr. Venables would
never be made up, &#383;till &#383;he agreed to
conceal me for the pre&#383;ent; yet a&#383;&#383;uring
me at the &#383;ame time, &#383;haking her
head, that, when a woman was once
married, &#383;he mu&#383;t bear every thing.
Her pale face, on which appeared a
thou&#383;and haggard lines and delving
wrinkles, produced by what is emphatically
termed fretting, inforced
her remark; and I had afterwards an
opportunity of ob&#383;erving the treatment
&#383;he had to endure, which grizzled her
into patience. She toiled from morning
till night; yet her hu&#383;band would rob
the till, and take away the money re<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-79_S" id="BPg_2-79_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-79.png">79</a>]</span>&#383;erved
for paying bills; and, returning
home drunk, he would beat her if &#383;he
chanced to offend him, though &#383;he had
a child at the brea&#383;t.</p>

<p>"The&#383;e &#383;cenes awoke me at night;
and, in the morning, I heard her, as
u&#383;ual, talk to her dear Johnny&mdash;he,
for&#383;ooth, was her ma&#383;ter; no &#383;lave in
the We&#383;t Indies had one more de&#383;potic;
but fortunately &#383;he was of the
true Ru&#383;&#383;ian breed of wives.</p>

<p>"My mind, during the few pa&#383;t
days, &#383;eemed, as it were, di&#383;engaged
from my body; but, now the &#383;truggle
was over, I felt very forcibly the effect
which perturbation of &#383;pirits produces
on a woman in my &#383;ituation.</p>

<p>"The apprehen&#383;ion of a mi&#383;carriage,
obliged me to confine my&#383;elf to
my apartment near a fortnight; but
I wrote to my uncle's friend for money,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-80_S" id="BPg_2-80_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-80.png">80</a>]</span>
promi&#383;ing 'to call on him, and explain
my &#383;ituation, when I was well enough
to go out; mean time I earne&#383;tly intreated
him, not to mention my place of
abode to any one, le&#383;t my hu&#383;band&mdash;&#383;uch
the law con&#383;idered him&mdash;&#383;hould
di&#383;turb the mind he could not conquer.
I mentioned my intention of &#383;etting out
for Li&#383;bon, to claim my uncle's protection,
the moment my health would
permit.'</p>

<p>"The tranquillity however, which
I was recovering, was &#383;oon interrupted.
My landlady came up to me one
day, with eyes &#383;wollen with weeping,
unable to utter what &#383;he was commanded
to &#383;ay. She declared, 'That
&#383;he was never &#383;o mi&#383;erable in her life;
that &#383;he mu&#383;t appear an ungrateful
mon&#383;ter; and that &#383;he would readily
go down on her knees to me, to intreat<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-81_S" id="BPg_2-81_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-81.png">81</a>]</span>
me to forgive her, as &#383;he had done to
her hu&#383;band to &#383;pare her the cruel
ta&#383;k.' Sobs prevented her from proceeding,
or an&#383;wering my impatient
enquiries, to know what &#383;he meant.</p>

<p>"When &#383;he became a little more
compo&#383;ed, &#383;he took a new&#383;paper out of
her pocket, declaring, 'that her heart
&#383;mote her, but what could &#383;he do?&mdash;&#383;he
mu&#383;t obey her hu&#383;band.' I &#383;natched
the paper from her. An adverti&#383;ement
quickly met my eye, purporting,
that 'Maria Venables had, without
any a&#383;&#383;ignable cau&#383;e, ab&#383;conded from
her hu&#383;band; and any per&#383;on harbouring
her, was menaced with the utmo&#383;t
&#383;everity of the law.'</p>

<p>"Perfectly acquainted with Mr.
Venables' meanne&#383;s of &#383;oul, this &#383;tep
did not excite my &#383;urpri&#383;e, and &#383;carcely
my contempt. Re&#383;entment in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-82_S" id="BPg_2-82_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-82.png">82</a>]</span>
brea&#383;t, never &#383;urvived love. I bade
the poor woman, in a kind tone, wipe
her eyes, and reque&#383;t her hu&#383;band to
come up, and &#383;peak to me him&#383;elf.</p>

<p>"My manner awed him. He re&#383;pected
a lady, though not a woman;
and began to mutter out an apology.</p>

<p>"'Mr. Venables was a rich gentleman;
he wi&#383;hed to oblige me, but he
had &#383;uffered enough by the law already,
to tremble at the thought;
be&#383;ides, for certain, we &#383;hould come
together again, and then even I &#383;hould
not thank him for being acce&#383;&#383;ary to
keeping us a&#383;under.&mdash;A hu&#383;band and
wife were, God knows, ju&#383;t as one,&mdash;and
all would come round at la&#383;t.' He
uttered a drawling 'Hem!' and then
with an arch look, added&mdash;'Ma&#383;ter
might have had his little frolics&mdash;but<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-83_S" id="BPg_2-83_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-83.png">83</a>]</span>&mdash;Lord
ble&#383;s your heart!&mdash;men would
be men while the world &#383;tands.'</p>

<p>"To argue with this privileged fir&#383;t-born
of rea&#383;on, I perceived, would be
vain. I therefore only reque&#383;ted him to
let me remain another day at his hou&#383;e,
while I &#383;ought for a lodging; and not
to inform Mr. Venables that I had ever
been &#383;heltered there.</p>

<p>"He con&#383;ented, becau&#383;e he had not
the courage to refu&#383;e a per&#383;on for whom
he had an habitual re&#383;pect; but I heard
the pent-up choler bur&#383;t forth in cur&#383;es,
when he met his wife, who was waiting
impatiently at the foot of the &#383;tairs,
to know what effect my expo&#383;tulations
would have on him.</p>

<p>"Without wa&#383;ting any time in the
fruitle&#383;s indulgence of vexation, I once
more &#383;et out in &#383;earch of an abode in<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-84_S" id="BPg_2-84_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-84.png">84</a>]</span>
which I could hide my&#383;elf for a few
weeks.</p>

<p>"Agreeing to pay an exorbitant
price, I hired an apartment, without
any reference being required relative
to my character: indeed, a glance
at my &#383;hape &#383;eemed to &#383;ay, that my
motive for concealment was &#383;ufficiently
obvious. Thus was I obliged to &#383;hroud
my head in infamy.</p>

<p>"To avoid all danger of detection&mdash;I
u&#383;e the appropriate word, my child,
for I was hunted out like a felon&mdash;I
determined to take po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of my
new lodgings that very evening.</p>

<p>"I did not inform my landlady
where I was going. I knew that &#383;he
had a &#383;incere affection for me, and
would willingly have run any ri&#383;k to
&#383;how her gratitude; yet I was fully convinced,
that a few kind words from<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-85_S" id="BPg_2-85_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-85.png">85</a>]</span>
Johnny would have found the woman
in her, and her dear benefactre&#383;s, as
&#383;he termed me in an agony of tears,
would have been &#383;acrificed, to recompen&#383;e
her tyrant for conde&#383;cending to
treat her like an equal. He could be
kind-hearted, as &#383;he expre&#383;&#383;ed it, when
he plea&#383;ed. And this thawed &#383;ternne&#383;s,
contra&#383;ted with his habitual brutality,
was the more acceptable, and
could not be purcha&#383;ed at too dear a
rate.</p>

<p>"The &#383;ight of the adverti&#383;ement
made me de&#383;irous of taking refuge with
my uncle, let what would be the con&#383;equence;
and I repaired in a hackney
coach (afraid of meeting &#383;ome per&#383;on
who might chance to know me, had I
walked) to the chambers of my uncle's
friend.</p>

<p>"He received me with great polite<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-86_S" id="BPg_2-86_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-86.png">86</a>]</span>ne&#383;s
(my uncle had already prepo&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed
him in my favour), and li&#383;tened, with
intere&#383;t, to my explanation of the
motives which had induced me to fly
from home, and &#383;kulk in ob&#383;curity,
with all the timidity of fear that ought
only to be the companion of guilt. He
lamented, with rather more gallantry
than, in my &#383;ituation, I thought delicate,
that &#383;uch a woman &#383;hould be
thrown away on a man in&#383;en&#383;ible to the
charms of beauty or grace. He &#383;eemed
at a lo&#383;s what to advi&#383;e me to do, to
evade my hu&#383;band's &#383;earch, without
ha&#383;tening to my uncle, whom, he he&#383;itating
&#383;aid, I might not find alive. He
uttered this intelligence with vi&#383;ible
regret; reque&#383;ted me, at lea&#383;t, to wait
for the arrival of the next packet; offered
me what money I wanted, and
promi&#383;ed to vi&#383;it me.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-87_S" id="BPg_2-87_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-87.png">87</a>]</span>
"He kept his word; &#383;till no letter
arrived to put an end to my painful
&#383;tate of &#383;u&#383;pen&#383;e. I procured &#383;ome
books and mu&#383;ic, to beguile the tedious
&#383;olitary days.</p>

<p>I &#383;ung&mdash;and &#383;ung till, &#383;addened by the
&#383;train of joy, I bitterly lamented the
fate that deprived me of all &#383;ocial plea&#383;ure.

<h2><a name="BCHAP_XIII_S" id="BCHAP_XIII_S"></a>CHAP. XIII.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">By</span> watching my only vi&#383;itor, my
uncle's friend, or by &#383;ome other means,
Mr. Venables di&#383;covered my re&#383;idence,
and came to enquire for me. The
maid-&#383;ervant a&#383;&#383;ured him there was no
&#383;uch per&#383;on in the hou&#383;e. A bu&#383;tle
en&#383;ued&mdash;I caught the alarm&mdash;li&#383;tened&mdash;di&#383;tingui&#383;hed
his voice, and immediately
locked the door. They &#383;uddenly
grew &#383;till; and I waited near a
quarter of an hour, before I heard him
open the parlour door, and mount the
&#383;tairs with the mi&#383;tre&#383;s of the hou&#383;e,
who ob&#383;equiou&#383;ly declared that &#383;he
knew nothing of me.</p>

<p>"Finding my door locked, &#383;he reque&#383;ted
me to 'open it, and prepare to<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-89_S" id="BPg_2-89_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-89.png">89</a>]</span>
go home with my hu&#383;band, poor gentleman!
to whom I had already occa&#383;ioned
&#383;ufficient vexation.' I made no
reply. Mr. Venables then, in an a&#383;&#383;umed
tone of &#383;oftne&#383;s, intreated me,
'to con&#383;ider what he &#383;uffered, and my
own reputation, and get the better of
childi&#383;h re&#383;entment.' He ran on in
the &#383;ame &#383;train, pretending to addre&#383;s
me, but evidently adapting his di&#383;cour&#383;e
to the capacity of the landlady;
who, at every pau&#383;e, uttered an exclamation
of pity; or 'Yes, to be &#383;ure&mdash;Very
true, &#383;ir.'</p>

<p>"Sick of the farce, and perceiving
that I could not avoid the hated interview,
I opened the door, and he entered.
Advancing with ea&#383;y a&#383;&#383;urance
to take my hand, I &#383;hrunk from his
touch, with an involuntary &#383;tart, as I
&#383;hould have done from a noi&#383;ome reptile,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-90_S" id="BPg_2-90_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-90.png">90</a>]</span>
with more di&#383;gu&#383;t than terror. His
conductre&#383;s was retiring, to give us, as
&#383;he &#383;aid, an opportunity to accommodate
matters. But I bade her come in,
or I would go out; and curio&#383;ity impelled
her to obey me.</p>

<p>"Mr. Venables began to expo&#383;tulate;
and this woman, proud of his
confidence, to &#383;econd him. But I
calmly &#383;ilenced her, in the mid&#383;t of a
vulgar harangue, and turning to him,
a&#383;ked, 'Why he vainly tormented me?
declaring that no power on earth
&#383;hould force me back to his hou&#383;e.'</p>

<p>"After a long altercation, the particulars
of which, it would be to no
purpo&#383;e to repeat, he left the room.
Some time was &#383;pent in loud conver&#383;ation
in the parlour below, and I
di&#383;covered that he had brought his
friend, an attorney, with him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-91_S" id="BPg_2-91_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-91.png">91</a>]</span></p>

<p>*&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; *&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; The tumult on the landing
place, brought out a gentleman, who
had recently taken apartments in the
hou&#383;e; he enquired why I was thus
a&#383;&#383;ailed<a name="BFNanchor_91-A_7_S" id="BFNanchor_91-A_7_S"></a><a href="#BFootnote_91-A_7_S" class="fnanchor">[91-A]</a>? The voluble attorney in&#383;tantly
repeated the trite tale. The
&#383;tranger turned to me, ob&#383;erving,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-92_S" id="BPg_2-92_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-92.png">92</a>]</span>
with the mo&#383;t &#383;oothing politene&#383;s and
manly intere&#383;t, that 'my countenance
told a very different &#383;tory.' He added,
'that I &#383;hould not be in&#383;ulted, or
forced out of the hou&#383;e, by any body.'</p>

<p>"'Not by her hu&#383;band?' a&#383;ked the
attorney.</p>

<p>"'No, &#383;ir, not by her hu&#383;band.' Mr.
Venables advanced towards him&mdash;But
there was a deci&#383;ion in his attitude,
that &#383;o well &#383;econded that of his voice,</p>
<p class="sp">* * * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>*&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; *&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; They left the hou&#383;e: at

that &#383;hould dare to protect me, &#383;hould
be pro&#383;ecuted with the utmo&#383;t rigour.</p>

<p>"They were &#383;carcely out of the
hou&#383;e, when my landlady came up to
me again, and begged my pardon, in
a very different tone. For, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-93_S" id="BPg_2-93_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-93.png">93</a>]</span>
Mr. Venables had bid her, at her peril,
harbour me, he had not attended, I
found, to her broad hints, to di&#383;charge
the lodging. I in&#383;tantly promi&#383;ed to
pay her, and make her a pre&#383;ent to
compen&#383;ate for my abrupt departure,
if &#383;he would procure me another lodging,
at a &#383;ufficient di&#383;tance; and &#383;he, in
return, repeating Mr. Venables' plau&#383;ible
tale, I rai&#383;ed her indignation, and
excited her &#383;ympathy, by telling her
briefly the truth.</p>

<p>"She expre&#383;&#383;ed her commi&#383;eration
with &#383;uch hone&#383;t warmth, that I felt
&#383;oothed; for I have none of that fa&#383;tidious
&#383;en&#383;itivene&#383;s, which a vulgar accent
or ge&#383;ture can alarm to the di&#383;regard
of real kindne&#383;s. I was ever glad
to perceive in others the humane feelings
I delighted to exerci&#383;e; and the
recollection of &#383;ome ridiculous charac<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-94_S" id="BPg_2-94_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-94.png">94</a>]</span>teri&#383;tic
circum&#383;tances, which have occurred
in a moment of emotion, has
convul&#383;ed me with laughter, though
at the in&#383;tant I &#383;hould have thought it
&#383;acrilegious to have &#383;miled. Your improvement,
my deare&#383;t girl, being ever
pre&#383;ent to me while I write, I note
the&#383;e feelings, becau&#383;e women, more
accu&#383;tomed to ob&#383;erve manners than
actions, are too much alive to ridicule.
So much &#383;o, that their boa&#383;ted &#383;en&#383;ibility
is often &#383;tifled by fal&#383;e delicacy.
True &#383;en&#383;ibility, the &#383;en&#383;ibility which
is the auxiliary of virtue, and the &#383;oul
of genius, is in &#383;ociety &#383;o occupied
with the feelings of others, as &#383;carcely
to regard its own &#383;en&#383;ations. With
what reverence have I looked up at my
uncle, the dear parent of my mind!
when I have &#383;een the &#383;en&#383;e of his own
&#383;ufferings, of mind and body, ab&#383;orbed<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-95_S" id="BPg_2-95_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-95.png">95</a>]</span>
in a de&#383;ire to comfort tho&#383;e, who&#383;e mi&#383;fortunes
were comparatively trivial.
He would have been a&#383;hamed of being
as indulgent to him&#383;elf, as he was to
others. 'Genuine fortitude,' he would
a&#383;&#383;ert, 'con&#383;i&#383;ted in governing our own
emotions, and making allowance for
the weakne&#383;&#383;es in our friends, that we
would not tolerate in our&#383;elves.' But
where is my fond regret leading me!</p>

<p>"'Women mu&#383;t be &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ive,' &#383;aid
my landlady. 'Indeed what could
mo&#383;t women do? Who had they to
maintain them, but their hu&#383;bands?
Every woman, and e&#383;pecially a lady,
could not go through rough and
&#383;mooth, as &#383;he had done, to earn a little
bread.'</p>

<p>"She was in a talking mood, and
proceeded to inform me how &#383;he had
been u&#383;ed in the world. 'She knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-96_S" id="BPg_2-96_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-96.png">96</a>]</span>
what it was to have a bad hu&#383;band, or
&#383;he did not know who &#383;hould.' I perceived
that &#383;he would be very much
mortified, were I not to attend to her
tale, and I did not attempt to interrupt
her, though I wi&#383;hed her, as &#383;oon
as po&#383;&#383;ible, to go out in &#383;earch of a new
abode for me, where I could once more
hide my head.</p>

<p>"She began by telling me, 'That
&#383;he had &#383;aved a little money in &#383;ervice;
and was over-per&#383;uaded (we mu&#383;t all
be in love once in our lives) to marry a
likely man, a footman in the family,
not worth a groat. My plan,' &#383;he continued,
'was to take a hou&#383;e, and let
out lodgings; and all went on well,
till my hu&#383;band got acquainted with
an impudent &#383;lut, who cho&#383;e to live on
other people's means&mdash;and then all
went to rack and ruin. He ran in<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-97_S" id="BPg_2-97_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-97.png">97</a>]</span>
debt to buy her fine clothes, &#383;uch
clothes as I never thought of wearing
my&#383;elf, and&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;he
&#383;igned an execution on my very
goods, bought with the money I
worked &#383;o hard to get; and they came
and took my bed from under me, before
I heard a word of the matter.
Aye, madam, the&#383;e are mi&#383;fortunes
that you gentlefolks know nothing of,&mdash;but
&#383;orrow is &#383;orrow, let it come
which way it will.</p>

<p>"'I &#383;ought for a &#383;ervice again&mdash;very
hard, after having a hou&#383;e of my own!&mdash;but
he u&#383;ed to follow me, and kick up
&#383;uch a riot when he was drunk, that I
could not keep a place; nay, he even
&#383;tole my clothes, and pawned them;
and when I went to the pawnbroker's,
and offered to take my oath that they
were not bought with a farthing of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-98_S" id="BPg_2-98_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-98.png">98</a>]</span>
money, they &#383;aid, 'It was all as one,
my hu&#383;band had a right to whatever I
had.'</p>

<p>"'At la&#383;t he li&#383;ted for a &#383;oldier, and
I took a hou&#383;e, making an agreement
to pay for the furniture by degrees;
and I almo&#383;t &#383;tarved my&#383;elf, till I once
more got before-hand in the world.</p>

<p>"'After an ab&#383;ence of &#383;ix years
(God forgive me! I thought he was
dead) my hu&#383;band returned; found me
out, and came with &#383;uch a penitent
face, I forgave him, and clothed him
from head to foot. But he had not
been a week in the hou&#383;e, before &#383;ome
of his creditors arre&#383;ted him; and, he
&#383;elling my goods, I found my&#383;elf once
more reduced to beggary; for I was
not as well able to work, go to bed
late, and ri&#383;e early, as when I quitted
&#383;ervice; and then I thought it hard<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-99_S" id="BPg_2-99_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-99.png">99</a>]</span>
enough. He was &#383;oon tired of me,
when there was nothing more to be
had, and left me again.</p>

<p>"<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added mi&#383;&#383;ing quotation mark">'</ins>I will not tell you how I was buffeted
about, till, hearing for certain
that he had died in an ho&#383;pital abroad,
I once more returned to my old occupation;
but have not yet been able to
get my head above water: &#383;o, madam,
you mu&#383;t not be angry if I am afraid to
run any ri&#383;k, when I know &#383;o well,
that women have always the wor&#383;t of
it, when law is to decide.'</p>

<p>"After uttering a few more complaints,
I prevailed on my landlady to
go out in que&#383;t of a lodging; and, to
be more &#383;ecure, I conde&#383;cended to the
mean &#383;hift of changing my name.</p>

<p>"But why &#383;hould I dwell on &#383;imilar
incidents!&mdash;I was hunted, like an infected
bea&#383;t, from three different apartments,
and &#383;hould not have been al<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-100_S" id="BPg_2-100_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-100.png">100</a>]</span>lowed
to re&#383;t in any, had not Mr. Venables,
informed of my uncle's dangerous
&#383;tate of health, been in&#383;pired with
the fear of hurrying me out of the
world as I advanced in my pregnancy,
by thus tormenting and obliging me to
take &#383;udden journeys to avoid him; and
then his &#383;peculations on my uncle's fortune
mu&#383;t prove abortive.</p>

<p>"One day, when he had pur&#383;ued me
to an inn, I fainted, hurrying from him;
and, falling down, the &#383;ight of my blood
alarmed him, and obtained a re&#383;pite for
me. It is &#383;trange that he &#383;hould have
retained any hope, after ob&#383;erving my
unwavering determination; but, from
the mildne&#383;s of my behaviour, when I
found all my endeavours to change his
di&#383;po&#383;ition unavailing, he formed an
erroneous opinion of my character, imagining
that, were we once more together,
I &#383;hould part with the money he<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-101_S" id="BPg_2-101_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-101.png">101</a>]</span>
could not legally force from me, with
the &#383;ame facility as formerly. My forbearance
and occa&#383;ional &#383;ympathy he
had mi&#383;taken for weakne&#383;s of character;
and, becau&#383;e he perceived that I
di&#383;liked re&#383;i&#383;tance, he thought my indulgence
and compa&#383;&#383;ion mere &#383;elfi&#383;hne&#383;s,
and never di&#383;covered that the fear of
being unju&#383;t, or of unnece&#383;&#383;arily wounding
the feelings of another, was much
more painful to me, than any thing I
could have to endure my&#383;elf. Perhaps
it was pride which made me imagine,
that I could bear what I dreaded to inflict;
and that it was often ea&#383;ier to &#383;uffer,
than to &#383;ee the &#383;ufferings of others.</p>

<p>"I forgot to mention that, during
this per&#383;ecution, I received a letter
from my uncle, informing me, 'that
he only found relief from continual
change of air; and that he intended to<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-102_S" id="BPg_2-102_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-102.png">102</a>]</span>
return when the &#383;pring was a little more
advanced (it was now the middle of
February), and then we would plan a
journey to Italy, leaving the fogs and
cares of England far behind.' He approved
of my conduct, promi&#383;ed to
adopt my child, and &#383;eemed to have
no doubt of obliging Mr. Venables to
hear rea&#383;on. He wrote to his friend,
by the &#383;ame po&#383;t, de&#383;iring him to call
on Mr. Venables in his name; and, in
con&#383;equence of the remon&#383;trances he
dictated, I was permitted to lie-in tranquilly.</p>

<p>"The two or three weeks previous, I
had been allowed to re&#383;t in peace; but,
&#383;o accu&#383;tomed was I to pur&#383;uit and
alarm, that I &#383;eldom clo&#383;ed my eyes
without being haunted by Mr. Venables'
image, who &#383;eemed to a&#383;&#383;ume terrific or
hateful forms to torment me, wherever<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-103_S" id="BPg_2-103_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-103.png">103</a>]</span>
I turned.&mdash;Sometimes a wild cat, a
roaring bull, or hideous a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;in, whom
I vainly attempted to fly; at others he
was a demon, hurrying me to the brink
of a precipice, plunging me into dark
waves, or horrid gulfs; and I woke,
in violent fits of trembling anxiety, to
a&#383;&#383;ure my&#383;elf that it was all a dream,
and to endeavour to lure my waking
thoughts to wander to the delightful
Italian vales, I hoped &#383;oon to vi&#383;it; or
to picture &#383;ome augu&#383;t ruins, where I
reclined in fancy on a mouldering column,
and e&#383;caped, in the contemplation
of the heart-enlarging virtues of antiquity,
from the turmoil of cares that
had depre&#383;&#383;ed all the daring purpo&#383;es
of my &#383;oul. But I was not long allowed
to calm my mind by the exerci&#383;e
of my imagination; for the third
day after your birth, my child, I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-104_S" id="BPg_2-104_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-104.png">104</a>]</span>
&#383;urpri&#383;ed by a vi&#383;it from my elder brother;
who came in the mo&#383;t abrupt
manner, to inform me of the death of
my uncle. He had left the greater
part of his fortune to my child, appointing
me its guardian; in &#383;hort,
every &#383;tep was taken to enable me to
be mi&#383;tre&#383;s of his fortune, without putting
any part of it in Mr. Venables'
power. My brother came to vent his
rage on me, for having, as he expre&#383;&#383;ed
him&#383;elf, 'deprived him, my uncle's
elde&#383;t nephew, of his inheritance;'
though my uncle's property, the fruit
of his own exertion, being all in the
funds, or on landed &#383;ecurities, there
was not a &#383;hadow of ju&#383;tice in the
charge.</p>

<p>"As I &#383;incerely loved my uncle, this
intelligence brought on a fever, which
I &#383;truggled to conquer with all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-105_S" id="BPg_2-105_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-105.png">105</a>]</span>
energy of my mind; for, in my de&#383;olate
&#383;tate, I had it very much at heart to
&#383;uckle you, my poor babe. You
&#383;eemed my only tie to life, a cherub,
to whom I wi&#383;hed to be a father, as
well as a mother; and the double duty
appeared to me to produce a proportionate
increa&#383;e of affection. But the
plea&#383;ure I felt, while &#383;u&#383;taining you,
&#383;natched from the wreck of hope, was
cruelly damped by melancholy reflections
on my widowed &#383;tate&mdash;widowed
by the death of my uncle. Of Mr.
Venables I thought not, even when I
thought of the felicity of loving your
father, and how a mother's plea&#383;ure
might be exalted, and her care &#383;oftened
by a hu&#383;band's tenderne&#383;s.&mdash;'Ought to
be!' I exclaimed; and I endeavoured
to drive away the tenderne&#383;s that &#383;uffo<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-106_S" id="BPg_2-106_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-106.png">106</a>]</span>cated
me; but my &#383;pirits were weak,
and the unbidden tears would flow.
'Why was I,' I would a&#383;k thee, but
thou did&#383;t not heed me,&mdash;'cut off from
the participation of the &#383;weete&#383;t plea&#383;ure
of life?' I imagined with what
extacy, after the pains of child-bed, I
&#383;hould have pre&#383;ented my little &#383;tranger,
whom I had &#383;o long wi&#383;hed to view, to
a re&#383;pectable father, and with what
maternal fondne&#383;s I &#383;hould have pre&#383;&#383;ed
them both to my heart!&mdash;Now I ki&#383;&#383;ed
her with le&#383;s delight, though with the
mo&#383;t endearing compa&#383;&#383;ion, poor helple&#383;s
one! when I perceived a &#383;light re&#383;emblance
of him, to whom &#383;he owed
her exi&#383;tence; or, if any ge&#383;ture reminded
me of him, even in his be&#383;t
days, my heart heaved, and I pre&#383;&#383;ed
the innocent to my bo&#383;om, as if to<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-107_S" id="BPg_2-107_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-107.png">107</a>]</span>
purify it&mdash;yes, I blu&#383;hed to think that
its purity had been &#383;ullied, by allowing
&#383;uch a man to be its father.</p>

<p>"After my recovery, I began to
think of taking a hou&#383;e in the country,
or of making an excur&#383;ion on the continent,
to avoid Mr. Venables; and to
open my heart to new plea&#383;ures and
affection. The &#383;pring was melting into
&#383;ummer, and you, my little companion,
began to &#383;mile&mdash;that &#383;mile
made hope bud out afre&#383;h, a&#383;&#383;uring me
the world was not a de&#383;ert. Your
ge&#383;tures were ever pre&#383;ent to my
fancy; and I dwelt on the joy I &#383;hould
feel when you would begin to walk and
li&#383;p. Watching your wakening mind,
and &#383;hielding from every rude bla&#383;t
my tender blo&#383;&#383;om, I recovered my
&#383;pirits&mdash;I dreamed not of the fro&#383;t<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-108_S" id="BPg_2-108_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-108.png">108</a>]</span>&mdash;'the
killing fro&#383;t,' to which you were
de&#383;tined to be expo&#383;ed.&mdash;But I lo&#383;e all
patience&mdash;and execrate the inju&#383;tice
of the world&mdash;folly! ignorance!&mdash;I
&#383;hould rather call it; but, &#383;hut up from
a free circulation of thought, and always
pondering on the &#383;ame griefs, I
writhe under the torturing apprehen&#383;ions,
which ought to excite only
hone&#383;t indignation, or active compa&#383;&#383;ion;
and would, could I view them
as the natural con&#383;equence of things.
But, born a woman&mdash;and born to &#383;uffer,
in endeavouring to repre&#383;s my own
emotions, I feel more acutely the various
ills my &#383;ex are fated to bear&mdash;I
feel that the evils they are &#383;ubject to
endure, degrade them &#383;o far below
their oppre&#383;&#383;ors, as almo&#383;t to ju&#383;tify
their tyranny; leading at the &#383;ame<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-109_S" id="BPg_2-109_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-109.png">109</a>]</span>
time &#383;uperficial rea&#383;oners to term that
weakne&#383;s the cau&#383;e, which is only
the con&#383;equence of &#383;hort-&#383;ighted de&#383;poti&#383;m.</p>

<h2><a name="BCHAP_XIV_S" id="BCHAP_XIV_S"></a>CHAP. XIV.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">As</span> my mind grew calmer, the
vi&#383;ions of Italy again returned with
their former glow of colouring; and I
re&#383;olved on quitting the kingdom for
a time, in &#383;earch of the cheerfulne&#383;s,
that naturally re&#383;ults from a change of
&#383;cene, unle&#383;s we carry the barbed arrow
with us, and only &#383;ee what we
feel.</p>

<p>"During the period nece&#383;&#383;ary to
prepare for a long ab&#383;ence, I &#383;ent a
&#383;upply to pay my father's debts, and
&#383;ettled my brothers in eligible &#383;ituations;
but my attention was not
wholly engro&#383;&#383;ed by my family, though
I do not think it nece&#383;&#383;ary to enumerate
the common exertions of huma<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-111_S" id="BPg_2-111_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-111.png">111</a>]</span>nity.
The manner in which my uncle's
property was &#383;ettled, prevented
me from making the addition to the
fortune of my &#383;urviving &#383;i&#383;ter, that I
could have wi&#383;hed; but I had prevailed
on him to bequeath her two
thou&#383;and pounds, and &#383;he determined
to marry a lover, to whom &#383;he had
been &#383;ome time attached. Had it not
been for this engagement, I &#383;hould have
invited her to accompany me in my
tour; and I might have e&#383;caped the
pit, &#383;o artfully dug in my path, when
I was the lea&#383;t aware of danger.</p>

<p>"I had thought of remaining in
England, till I weaned my child; but
this &#383;tate of freedom was too peaceful
to la&#383;t, and I had &#383;oon rea&#383;on to wi&#383;h
to ha&#383;ten my departure. A friend of
Mr. Venables, the &#383;ame attorney who
had accompanied him in &#383;everal excur<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-112_S" id="BPg_2-112_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-112.png">112</a>]</span>&#383;ions
to hunt me from my hiding places,
waited on me to propo&#383;e a reconciliation.
On my refu&#383;al, he indirectly
advi&#383;ed me to make over to my hu&#383;band&mdash;for
hu&#383;band he would term
him&mdash;the greater part of the property
I had at command, menacing me with
continual per&#383;ecution unle&#383;s I complied,
and that, as a la&#383;t re&#383;ort, he
would claim the child. I did not,
though intimidated by the la&#383;t in&#383;inuation,
&#383;cruple to declare, that I would
not allow him to &#383;quander the money
left to me for far different purpo&#383;es,
but offered him five hundred pounds, if
he would &#383;ign a bond not to torment
me any more. My maternal anxiety
made me thus appear to waver from
my fir&#383;t determination, and probably
&#383;ugge&#383;ted to him, or his diabolical<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-113_S" id="BPg_2-113_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-113.png">113</a>]</span>
agent, the infernal plot, which has
&#383;ucceeded but too well.</p>

<p>"The bond was executed; &#383;till I
was impatient to leave England. Mi&#383;chief
hung in the air when we breathed
the &#383;ame; I wanted &#383;eas to divide
us, and waters to roll between, till he
had forgotten that I had the means of
helping him through a new &#383;cheme.
Di&#383;turbed by the late occurrences, I in&#383;tantly
prepared for my departure.
My only delay was waiting for a maid-&#383;ervant,
who &#383;poke French fluently,
and had been warmly recommended to
me. A valet I was advi&#383;ed to hire,
when I fixed on my place of re&#383;idence
for any time.</p>

<p>"My God, with what a light heart
did I &#383;et out for Dover!&mdash;It was not my
country, but my cares, that I was leaving
behind. My heart &#383;eemed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-114_S" id="BPg_2-114_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-114.png">114</a>]</span>
bound with the wheels, or rather appeared
the centre on which they twirled.
I cla&#383;ped you to my bo&#383;om, exclaiming
'And you will be &#383;afe&mdash;quite
&#383;afe&mdash;when&mdash;we are once on
board the packet.&mdash;Would we were
there!' I &#383;miled at my idle fears, as
the natural effect of continual alarm;
and I &#383;carcely owned to my&#383;elf that I
dreaded Mr. Venables's cunning, or
was con&#383;cious of the horrid delight he
would feel, at forming &#383;tratagem after
&#383;tratagem to circumvent me. I was
already in the &#383;nare&mdash;I never reached
the packet&mdash;I never &#383;aw thee more.&mdash;I
grow breathle&#383;s. I have &#383;carcely patience
to write down the details. The
maid&mdash;the plau&#383;ible woman I had
hired&mdash;put, doubtle&#383;s, &#383;ome &#383;tupifying
potion in what I ate or drank, the
morning I left town. All I know is,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-115_S" id="BPg_2-115_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-115.png">115</a>]</span>
that &#383;he mu&#383;t have quitted the chai&#383;e,
&#383;hamele&#383;s wretch! and taken (from
my brea&#383;t) my babe with her. How
could a creature in a female form &#383;ee
me care&#383;s thee, and &#383;teal thee from my
arms! I mu&#383;t &#383;top, &#383;top to repre&#383;s a
mother's angui&#383;h; left, in bitterne&#383;s of
&#383;oul, I imprecate the wrath of heaven
on this tiger, who tore my only comfort
from me.</p>

<p>"How long I &#383;lept I know not;
certainly many hours, for I woke at the
clo&#383;e of day, in a &#383;trange confu&#383;ion of
thought. I was probably rou&#383;ed to recollection
by &#383;ome one thundering at a
huge, unwieldy gate. Attempting to
a&#383;k where I was, my voice died away,
and I tried to rai&#383;e it in vain, as I have
done in a dream. I looked for my babe
with affright; feared that it had fallen
out of my lap, while I had &#383;o &#383;trange<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-116_S" id="BPg_2-116_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-116.png">116</a>]</span>ly
forgotten her; and, &#383;uch was the
vague intoxication, I can give it no
other name, in which I was plunged,
I could not recollect when or where I
la&#383;t &#383;aw you; but I &#383;ighed, as if my
heart wanted room to clear my head.</p>

<p>"The gates opened heavily, and
the &#383;ullen &#383;ound of many locks
<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'and and'">and</ins> bolts drawn back, grated on
my very &#383;oul, before I was appalled by
the creeking of the di&#383;mal hinges, as
they clo&#383;ed after me. The gloomy
pile was before me, half in ruins; &#383;ome
of the aged trees of the avenue were
cut down, and left to rot where they
fell; and as we approached &#383;ome
mouldering &#383;teps, a mon&#383;trous dog
darted forwards to the length of his
chain, and barked and growled infernally.</p>

<p>"The door was opened &#383;lowly, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-117_S" id="BPg_2-117_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-117.png">117</a>]</span>
a murderous vi&#383;age peeped out, with a
lantern. 'Hu&#383;h!' he uttered, in a
threatning tone, and the affrighted
animal &#383;tole back to his kennel. The
door of the chai&#383;e flew back, the
&#383;tranger put down the lantern, and
cla&#383;ped his dreadful arms around me.
It was certainly the effect of the &#383;oporific
draught, for, in&#383;tead of exerting
my &#383;trength, I &#383;unk without motion,
though not without &#383;en&#383;e, on his &#383;houlder,
my limbs refu&#383;ing to obey my
will. I was carried up the &#383;teps into a
clo&#383;e-&#383;hut hall. A candle flaring in
the &#383;ocket, &#383;carcely di&#383;per&#383;ed the darkne&#383;s,
though it di&#383;played to me the
ferocious countenance of the wretch
who held me.</p>

<p>"He mounted a wide &#383;tairca&#383;e.
Large figures painted on the walls
&#383;eemed to &#383;tart on me, and glaring<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-118_S" id="BPg_2-118_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-118.png">118</a>]</span>
eyes to meet me at every turn. Entering
a long gallery, a di&#383;mal &#383;hriek made
me &#383;pring out of my conductor's arms,
with I know not what my&#383;terious emotion
of terror; but I fell on the floor,
unable to &#383;u&#383;tain my&#383;elf.</p>

<p>"A &#383;trange-looking female &#383;tarted
out of one of the rece&#383;&#383;es, and ob&#383;erved
me with more curio&#383;ity than intere&#383;t;
till, &#383;ternly bid retire, &#383;he flitted back
like a &#383;hadow. Other faces, &#383;trongly
marked, or di&#383;torted, peeped through
the half-opened doors, and I heard
&#383;ome incoherent &#383;ounds. I had no
di&#383;tinct idea where I could be&mdash;I looked
on all &#383;ides, and almo&#383;t doubted whether
I was alive or dead.</p>

<p>"Thrown on a bed, I immediately
&#383;unk into in&#383;en&#383;ibility again; and next
day, gradually recovering the u&#383;e of
rea&#383;on, I began, &#383;tarting affrighted<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-119_S" id="BPg_2-119_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-119.png">119</a>]</span>
from the conviction, to di&#383;cover where
I was confined&mdash;I in&#383;i&#383;ted on &#383;eeing the
ma&#383;ter of the man&#383;ion&mdash;I &#383;aw him&mdash;and
perceived that I was buried alive.&mdash;</p>

<p>"Such, my child, are the events of
thy mother's life to this dreadful moment&mdash;Should
&#383;he ever e&#383;cape from
the fangs of her enemies, &#383;he will add
the &#383;ecrets of her pri&#383;on-hou&#383;e&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Some lines were here cro&#383;&#383;ed out,
and the memoirs broke off abruptly
with the names of Jemima and Darnford.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darnford</span> returned the memoirs
to Maria, with a mo&#383;t affectionate
letter, in which he rea&#383;oned on "the
ab&#383;urdity of the laws re&#383;pecting matrimony,
which, till divorces could be
more ea&#383;ily obtained, was," he declared,
"the mo&#383;t in&#383;ufferable bondage. Ties of
this nature could not bind minds governed
by &#383;uperior principles; and &#383;uch
beings were privileged to act above the
dictates of laws they had no voice in
framing, if they had &#383;ufficient &#383;trength
of mind to endure the natural con&#383;equence.
In her ca&#383;e, to talk of duty,
was a farce, excepting what was due
to her&#383;elf. Delicacy, as well as rea&#383;on,
forbade her ever to think of returning<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-124_S" id="BPg_2-124_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-124.png">124</a>]</span>
to her hu&#383;band: was &#383;he then to re&#383;train
her charming &#383;en&#383;ibility through
mere prejudice? The&#383;e arguments
were not ab&#383;olutely impartial, for he
di&#383;dained to conceal, that, when he
appealed to her rea&#383;on, he felt that
he had &#383;ome intere&#383;t in her heart.&mdash;The
conviction was not more tran&#383;porting,
than &#383;acred&mdash;a thou&#383;and times a
day, he a&#383;ked him&#383;elf how he had merited
&#383;uch happine&#383;s?&mdash;and as often he
determined to purify the heart &#383;he
deigned to inhabit&mdash;He intreated to be
again admitted to her pre&#383;ence."</p>

<p>He was; and the tear which gli&#383;tened
in his eye, when he re&#383;pectfully
pre&#383;&#383;ed her to his bo&#383;om, rendered him
peculiarly dear to the unfortunate mother.
Grief had &#383;tilled the tran&#383;ports
of love, only to render their mutual
tenderne&#383;s more touching. In former<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-125_S" id="BPg_2-125_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-125.png">125</a>]</span>
interviews, Darnford had contrived, by
a hundred little pretexts, to &#383;it near
her, to take her hand, or to meet her
eyes&mdash;now it was all &#383;oothing affection,
and e&#383;teem &#383;eemed to have rivalled
love. He adverted to her narrative,
and &#383;poke with warmth of the oppre&#383;&#383;ion
&#383;he had endured.&mdash;His eyes, glowing
with a lambent flame, told her
how much he wi&#383;hed to re&#383;tore her to
liberty and love; but he ki&#383;&#383;ed her
hand, as if it had been that of a &#383;aint;
and &#383;poke of the lo&#383;s of her child, as if it
had been his own.&mdash;What could have
been more flattering to Maria?&mdash;Every
in&#383;tance of &#383;elf-denial was regi&#383;tered in
her heart, and &#383;he loved him, for loving
her too well to give way to the
tran&#383;ports of pa&#383;&#383;ion.</p>

<p>They met again and again; and
Darnford declared, while pa&#383;&#383;ion &#383;uf<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-126_S" id="BPg_2-126_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-126.png">126</a>]</span>fu&#383;ed
his cheeks, that he never before
knew what it was to love.&mdash;</p>

<p>One morning Jemima informed
Maria, that her ma&#383;ter intended to
wait on her, and &#383;peak to her without
witne&#383;&#383;es. He came, and brought a
letter with him, pretending that he
was ignorant of its contents, though he
in&#383;i&#383;ted on having it returned to him.
It was from the attorney already mentioned,
who informed her of the death
of her child, and hinted, "that &#383;he
could not now have a legitimate heir,
and that, would &#383;he make over the
half of her fortune during life, &#383;he
&#383;hould be conveyed to Dover, and permitted
to pur&#383;ue her plan of travelling."</p>

<p>Maria an&#383;wered with warmth,
"That &#383;he had no terms to make with
the murderer of her babe, nor would<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-127_S" id="BPg_2-127_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-127.png">127</a>]</span>
&#383;he purcha&#383;e liberty at the price of her
own re&#383;pect."</p>

<p>She began to expo&#383;tulate with her
jailor; but he &#383;ternly bade her "Be
&#383;ilent&mdash;he had not gone &#383;o far, not to
go further."</p>

<p>Darnford came in the evening.
Jemima was obliged to be ab&#383;ent, and
&#383;he, as u&#383;ual, locked the door on them,
to prevent interruption or di&#383;covery.&mdash;The
lovers were, at fir&#383;t, embarra&#383;&#383;ed;
but fell in&#383;en&#383;ibly into confidential di&#383;cour&#383;e.
Darnford repre&#383;ented, "that
they might &#383;oon be parted," and wi&#383;hed
her "to put it out of the power of fate
to &#383;eparate them."</p>

<p>As her hu&#383;band &#383;he now received him,
and he &#383;olemnly pledged him&#383;elf as her
protector&mdash;and eternal friend.&mdash;</p>

<p>There was one peculiarity in Maria's
mind: &#383;he was more anxious not
to deceive, than to guard again&#383;t de<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-128_S" id="BPg_2-128_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-128.png">128</a>]</span>ception;
and had rather tru&#383;t without
&#383;ufficient rea&#383;on, than be for ever the
prey of doubt. Be&#383;ides, what are we,
when the mind has, from reflection, a
certain kind of elevation, which exalts
the contemplation above the little concerns
of prudence! We &#383;ee what we
wi&#383;h, and make a world of our own&mdash;and,
though reality may &#383;ometimes open
a door to mi&#383;ery, yet the moments of
happine&#383;s procured by the imagination,
may, without a paradox, be reckoned
among the &#383;olid comforts of life. Maria
now, imagining that &#383;he had found
a being of cele&#383;tial mould&mdash;was happy,&mdash;nor
was &#383;he deceived.&mdash;He was then
pla&#383;tic in her impa&#383;&#383;ioned hand&mdash;and
reflected all the &#383;entiments which animated
and warmed her.&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="BCHAP_XVI_S" id="BCHAP_XVI_S"></a>CHAP. XVI.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> morning confu&#383;ion &#383;eemed to
reign in the hou&#383;e, and Jemima came
in terror, to inform Maria, "that her
ma&#383;ter had left it, with a determination,
&#383;he was a&#383;&#383;ured (and too many
circum&#383;tances corroborated the opinion,
to leave a doubt of its truth) of never
returning. I am prepared then,"
&#383;aid Jemima, "to accompany you in
your flight."</p>

<p>Maria &#383;tarted up, her eyes darting
towards the door, as if afraid that &#383;ome
one &#383;hould fa&#383;ten it on her for ever.</p>

<p>Jemima continued, "I have perhaps
no right now to expect the performance
of your promi&#383;e; but on you<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-130_S" id="BPg_2-130_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-130.png">130</a>]</span>
it depends to reconcile me with the
human race."</p>

<p>"But Darnford!"&mdash;exclaimed Maria,
mournfully&mdash;&#383;itting down again,
and cro&#383;&#383;ing her arms&mdash;"I have no
child to go to, and liberty has lo&#383;t its
&#383;weets."</p>

<p>"I am much mi&#383;taken, if Darnford
is not the cau&#383;e of my ma&#383;ter's flight&mdash;his
keepers a&#383;&#383;ure me, that they have
promi&#383;ed to confine him two days
longer, and then he will be free&mdash;you
cannot &#383;ee him; but they will give a
letter to him the moment he is free.&mdash;In
that inform him where he may find
you in London; fix on &#383;ome hotel.
Give me your clothes; I will &#383;end them
out of the hou&#383;e with mine, and we
will &#383;lip out at the garden-gate. Write
your letter while I make the&#383;e arrangements,
but lo&#383;e no time!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-131_S" id="BPg_2-131_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-131.png">131</a>]</span>
In an agitation of &#383;pirit, not to be
calmed, Maria began to write to Darnford.
She called him by the &#383;acred
name of "hu&#383;band," and bade him "ha&#383;ten
to her, to &#383;hare her fortune, or &#383;he
would return to him."&mdash;An hotel in the
Adelphi was the place of rendezvous.</p>

<p>The letter was &#383;ealed and given in
charge; and with light foot&#383;teps, yet
terrified at the &#383;ound of them, &#383;he de&#383;cended,
&#383;carcely breathing, and with
an indi&#383;tinct fear that &#383;he &#383;hould never
get out at the garden gate. Jemima
went fir&#383;t.</p>

<p>A being, with a vi&#383;age that would
have &#383;uited one po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed by a devil,
cro&#383;&#383;ed the path, and &#383;eized Maria by
the arm. Maria had no fear but of being
detained&mdash;"Who are you? what
are you?" for the form was &#383;carcely human.
"If you are made of fle&#383;h and<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-132_S" id="BPg_2-132_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-132.png">132</a>]</span>
blood," his gha&#383;tly eyes glared on her,
"do not &#383;top me!"</p>

<p>"Woman," interrupted a &#383;epulchral
voice, "what have I to do with thee?"&mdash;Still
he gra&#383;ped her hand, muttering
a cur&#383;e.</p>

<p>"No, no; you have nothing to do
with me," &#383;he exclaimed, "this is a
moment of life and death!"&mdash;</p>

<p>With &#383;upernatural force &#383;he broke
from him, and, throwing her arms
round Jemima, cried, "Save me!" The
being, from who&#383;e gra&#383;p &#383;he had loo&#383;ed
her&#383;elf, took up a &#383;tone as they opened
the door, and with a kind of helli&#383;h
&#383;port threw it after them. They were
out of his reach.</p>

<p>When Maria arrived in town, &#383;he
drove to the hotel already fixed on. But
&#383;he could not &#383;it &#383;till&mdash;her child was ever
before her; and all that had pa&#383;&#383;ed dur<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-133_S" id="BPg_2-133_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-133.png">133</a>]</span>ing
her confinement, appeared to be a
dream. She went to the hou&#383;e in the
&#383;uburbs, where, as &#383;he now di&#383;covered,
her babe had been &#383;ent. The moment
&#383;he entered, her heart grew &#383;ick; but
&#383;he wondered not that it had proved its
grave. She made the nece&#383;&#383;ary enquiries,
and the church-yard was pointed
out, in which it re&#383;ted under a turf. A
little frock which the nur&#383;e's child
wore (Maria had made it her&#383;elf)
caught her eye. The nur&#383;e was glad
to &#383;ell it for half-a-guinea, and Maria
ha&#383;tened away with the relic, and, re-entering
the hackney-coach which
waited for her, gazed on it, till &#383;he
reached her hotel.</p>

<p>She then waited on the attorney
who had made her uncle's will, and explained
to him her &#383;ituation. He readily
advanced her &#383;ome of the money<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-134_S" id="BPg_2-134_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-134.png">134</a>]</span>
which &#383;till remained in his hands, and
promi&#383;ed to take the whole of the ca&#383;e
into con&#383;ideration. Maria only wi&#383;hed
to be permitted to remain in quiet&mdash;She
found that &#383;everal bills, apparently
with her &#383;ignature, had been pre&#383;ented
to her agent, nor was &#383;he for a moment
at a lo&#383;s to gue&#383;s by whom they had
been forged; yet, equally aver&#383;e to
threaten or intreat, &#383;he reque&#383;ted her
friend [the &#383;olicitor] to call on Mr. Venables.
He was not to be found at
home; but at length his agent, the attorney,
offered a conditional promi&#383;e to
Maria, to leave her in peace, as long as
&#383;he behaved with propriety, if &#383;he
would give up the notes. Maria incon&#383;iderately
con&#383;ented&mdash;Darnford was
arrived, and &#383;he wi&#383;hed to be only alive
to love; &#383;he wi&#383;hed to forget the angui&#383;h
&#383;he felt whenever &#383;he thought of
her child.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-135_S" id="BPg_2-135_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-135.png">135</a>]</span>
They took a ready furni&#383;hed lodging
together, for &#383;he was above di&#383;gui&#383;e;
Jemima in&#383;i&#383;ting on being con&#383;idered
as her hou&#383;e-keeper, and to receive
the cu&#383;tomary &#383;tipend. On no
other terms would &#383;he remain with her
friend.</p>

<p>Darnford was indefatigable in tracing
the my&#383;terious circum&#383;tances of
his confinement. The cau&#383;e was &#383;imply,
that a relation, a very di&#383;tant one,
to whom he was heir, had died inte&#383;tate,
leaving a con&#383;iderable fortune.
On the news of Darnford's arrival [in
England, a per&#383;on, intru&#383;ted with the
management of the property, and who
had the writings in his po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion, determining,
by one bold &#383;troke, to &#383;trip
Darnford of the &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ion,] had planned
his confinement; and [as &#383;oon
as he had taken the mea&#383;ures he<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-136_S" id="BPg_2-136_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-136.png">136</a>]</span>
judged mo&#383;t conducive to his object,
this ruffian, together with his in&#383;trument,]
the keeper of the private mad-hou&#383;e,
left the kingdom. Darnford,
who &#383;till pur&#383;ued his enquiries, at la&#383;t
di&#383;covered that they had fixed their
place of refuge at Paris.</p>

<p>Maria and he determined therefore,
with the faithful Jemima, to vi&#383;it
that metropolis, and accordingly were
preparing for the journey, when they
were informed that Mr. Venables had
commenced an action again&#383;t Darnford
for &#383;eduction and adultery. The indignation
Maria felt cannot be explained;
&#383;he repented of the forbearance &#383;he had
exerci&#383;ed in giving up the notes. Darnford
could not put off his journey, without
ri&#383;king the lo&#383;s of his property:
Maria therefore furni&#383;hed him with money
for his expedition; and determined<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-137_S" id="BPg_2-137_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-137.png">137</a>]</span>
to remain in London till the termination
of this affair.</p>

<p>She vi&#383;ited &#383;ome ladies with whom
&#383;he had formerly been intimate, but
was refu&#383;ed admittance; and at the
opera, or Ranelagh, they could not recollect
her. Among the&#383;e ladies there
were &#383;ome, not her mo&#383;t intimate acquaintance,
who were generally &#383;uppo&#383;ed
to avail them&#383;elves of the cloke
of marriage, to conceal a mode of conduct,
that would for ever have damned
their fame, had they been innocent, &#383;educed
girls. The&#383;e particularly &#383;tood
aloof.&mdash;Had &#383;he remained with her hu&#383;band,
practi&#383;ing in&#383;incerity, and neglecting
her child to manage an intrigue,
&#383;he would &#383;till have been vi&#383;ited
and re&#383;pected. If, in&#383;tead of
openly living with her lover, &#383;he could
have conde&#383;cended to call into play a<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-138_S" id="BPg_2-138_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-138.png">138</a>]</span>
thou&#383;and arts, which, degrading her
own mind, might have allowed the
people who were not deceived, to pretend
to be &#383;o, &#383;he would have been
care&#383;&#383;ed and treated like an honourable
woman. "And Brutus<a name="BFNanchor_138-A_8_S" id="BFNanchor_138-A_8_S"></a><a href="#BFootnote_138-A_8_S" class="fnanchor">[138-A]</a> is an honourable
man!" &#383;aid Mark-Antony with
equal &#383;incerity.</p>

<p>With Darnford &#383;he did not ta&#383;te uninterrupted
felicity; there was a volatility
in his manner which often di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;ed
her; but love gladdened the
&#383;cene; be&#383;ides, he was the mo&#383;t tender,
&#383;ympathizing creature in the world.
A fondne&#383;s for the &#383;ex often gives an
appearance of humanity to the behaviour
of men, who have &#383;mall preten&#383;ions
to the reality; and they &#383;eem to<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-139_S" id="BPg_2-139_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-139.png">139</a>]</span>
love others, when they are only pur&#383;uing
their own gratification. Darnford
appeared ever willing to avail him&#383;elf
of her ta&#383;te and acquirements, while
&#383;he endeavoured to profit by his deci&#383;ion
of character, and to eradicate &#383;ome
of the romantic notions, which had
taken root in her mind, while in adver&#383;ity
&#383;he had brooded over vi&#383;ions of
unattainable bli&#383;s.</p>

<p>The real affections of life, when
they are allowed to bur&#383;t forth, are buds
pregnant with joy and all the &#383;weet
emotions of the &#383;oul; yet they branch
out with wild ea&#383;e, unlike the artificial
forms of felicity, &#383;ketched by an imagination
painful alive. The &#383;ub&#383;tantial
happine&#383;s, which enlarges and civilizes
the mind, may be compared to
the plea&#383;ure experienced in roving
through nature at large, inhaling the<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-140_S" id="BPg_2-140_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-140.png">140</a>]</span>
&#383;weet gale natural to the clime; while
the reveries of a feveri&#383;h imagination
continually &#383;port them&#383;elves in gardens
full of aromatic &#383;hrubs, which cloy
while they delight, and weaken the
&#383;en&#383;e of plea&#383;ure they gratify. The heaven
of fancy, below or beyond the &#383;tars,
in this life, or in tho&#383;e ever-&#383;miling regions
&#383;urrounded by the unmarked
ocean of futurity, have an in&#383;ipid uniformity
which palls. Poets have imagined
&#383;cenes of bli&#383;s; but, fencing out
&#383;orrow, all the extatic emotions of the
&#383;oul, and even its grandeur, &#383;eem to
be equally excluded. We do&#383;e over
the unruffled lake, and long to &#383;cale
the rocks which fence the happy valley
of contentment, though &#383;erpents hi&#383;s
in the pathle&#383;s de&#383;ert, and danger lurks
in the unexplored wiles. Maria found
her&#383;elf more indulgent as &#383;he was hap<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-141_S" id="BPg_2-141_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-141.png">141</a>]</span>pier,
and di&#383;covered virtues, in characters
&#383;he had before di&#383;regarded, while
cha&#383;ing the phantoms of elegance and
excellence, which &#383;ported in the meteors
that exhale in the mar&#383;hes of mi&#383;fortune.
The heart is often &#383;hut by
romance again&#383;t &#383;ocial plea&#383;ure; and,
fo&#383;tering a &#383;ickly &#383;en&#383;ibility, grows callous
to the &#383;oft touches of humanity.</p>

<p>To part with Darnford was indeed
cruel.&mdash;It was to feel mo&#383;t painfully
alone; but &#383;he rejoiced to think, that
&#383;he &#383;hould &#383;pare him the care and perplexity
of the &#383;uit, and meet him again,
all his own. Marriage, as at pre&#383;ent
con&#383;tituted, &#383;he con&#383;idered as leading
to immorality&mdash;yet, as the odium of
&#383;ociety impedes u&#383;efulne&#383;s, &#383;he wi&#383;hed to
avow her affection to Darnford, by becoming
his wife according to e&#383;tabli&#383;hed
rules; not to be confounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-142_S" id="BPg_2-142_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-142.png">142</a>]</span>
with women who act from very different
motives, though her conduct would
be ju&#383;t the &#383;ame without the ceremony
as with it, and her expectations from
him not le&#383;s firm. The being &#383;ummoned
to defend her&#383;elf from a charge which
&#383;he was determined to plead guilty to,
was &#383;till galling, as it rou&#383;ed bitter reflections
on the &#383;ituation of women in
&#383;ociety.</p>

<h2><a name="BCHAP_XVII_S" id="BCHAP_XVII_S"></a>CHAP. XVII.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Such</span> was her &#383;tate of mind when
the dogs of law were let loo&#383;e on
her. Maria took the ta&#383;k of conducting
Darnford's defence upon her&#383;elf.
She in&#383;tructed his coun&#383;el to plead
guilty to the charge of adultery; but
to deny that of &#383;eduction.</p>

<p>The coun&#383;el for the plaintiff opened
the cau&#383;e, by ob&#383;erving, "that his client
had ever been an indulgent hu&#383;band,
and had borne with &#383;everal defects
of temper, while he had nothing
criminal to lay to the charge of his
wife. But that &#383;he left his hou&#383;e without
a&#383;&#383;igning any cau&#383;e. He could not
a&#383;&#383;ert that &#383;he was then acquainted
with the defendant; yet, when he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-144_S" id="BPg_2-144_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-144.png">144</a>]</span>
once endeavouring to bring her back
to her home, this man put the peace-officers
to flight, and took her he knew
not whither. After the birth of her child,
her conduct was &#383;o &#383;trange, and a melancholy
malady having afflicted one of
the family, which delicacy forbade the
dwelling on, it was nece&#383;&#383;ary to confine
her. By &#383;ome means the defendant
enabled her to make her e&#383;cape,
and they had lived together, in de&#383;pite
of all &#383;en&#383;e of order and decorum. The
adultery was allowed, it was not nece&#383;&#383;ary
to bring any witne&#383;&#383;es to prove it;
but the &#383;eduction, though highly probable
from the circum&#383;tances which
he had the honour to &#383;tate, could not
be &#383;o clearly proved.&mdash;It was of the
mo&#383;t atrocious kind, as decency was &#383;et
at defiance, and re&#383;pect for reputa<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-145_S" id="BPg_2-145_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-145.png">145</a>]</span>tion,
which &#383;hows internal compunction,
utterly di&#383;regarded."</p>

<p>A &#383;trong &#383;en&#383;e of inju&#383;tice had &#383;ilenced
every emotion, which a mixture
of true and fal&#383;e delicacy might otherwi&#383;e
have excited in Maria's bo&#383;om.
She only felt in earne&#383;t to in&#383;i&#383;t on the
privilege of her nature. The &#383;arca&#383;ms
of &#383;ociety, and the condemnation of a
mi&#383;taken world, were nothing to her,
compared with acting contrary to tho&#383;e
feelings which were the foundation of
her principles. [She therefore eagerly
put her&#383;elf forward, in&#383;tead of de&#383;iring
to be ab&#383;ent, on this memorable occa&#383;ion.]</p>

<p>Convinced that the &#383;ubterfuges of
the law were di&#383;graceful, &#383;he wrote a
paper, which &#383;he expre&#383;&#383;ly de&#383;ired might
be read in court:</p>

<p>"Married when &#383;carcely able to di&#383;<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-146_S" id="BPg_2-146_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-146.png">146</a>]</span>tingui&#383;h
the nature of the engagement,
I yet &#383;ubmitted to the rigid
laws which en&#383;lave women, and obeyed
the man whom I could no longer love.
Whether the duties of the &#383;tate are
reciprocal, I mean not to di&#383;cu&#383;s; but
I can prove repeated infidelities which
I overlooked or pardoned. Witne&#383;&#383;es
are not wanting to e&#383;tabli&#383;h the&#383;e facts.
I at pre&#383;ent maintain the child of a
maid &#383;ervant, &#383;worn to him, and born
after our marriage. I am ready to allow,
that education and circum&#383;tances
lead men to think and act with le&#383;s delicacy,
than the pre&#383;ervation of order
in &#383;ociety demands from women; but
&#383;urely I may without a&#383;&#383;umption declare,
that, though I could excu&#383;e the
birth, I could not the de&#383;ertion of this
unfortunate babe:&mdash;and, while I de&#383;pi&#383;ed
the man, it was not ea&#383;y to ve<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-147_S" id="BPg_2-147_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-147.png">147</a>]</span>nerate
the hu&#383;band. With proper re&#383;trictions
however, I revere the in&#383;titution
which fraternizes the world. I exclaim
again&#383;t the laws which throw the
whole weight of the yoke on the weaker
&#383;houlders, and force women, when they
claim protector&#383;hip as mothers, to &#383;ign
a contract, which renders them dependent
on the caprice of the tyrant, whom
choice or nece&#383;&#383;ity has appointed to
reign over them. Various are the ca&#383;es,
in which a woman ought to &#383;eparate
her&#383;elf from her hu&#383;band; and mine,
I may be allowed emphatically to in&#383;i&#383;t,
comes under the de&#383;cription of the
mo&#383;t aggravated.</p>

<p>"I will not enlarge on tho&#383;e provocations
which only the individual can
e&#383;timate; but will bring forward &#383;uch
charges only, the truth of which is an
in&#383;ult upon humanity. In order to<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-148_S" id="BPg_2-148_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-148.png">148</a>]</span>
promote certain de&#383;tructive &#383;peculations,
Mr. Venables prevailed on me
to borrow certain &#383;ums of a wealthy relation;
and, when I refu&#383;ed further
compliance, he thought of bartering
my per&#383;on; and not only allowed opportunities
to, but urged, a friend
from whom he borrowed money, to
&#383;educe me. On the di&#383;covery of this
act of atrocity, I determined to leave
him, and in the mo&#383;t decided manner,
for ever. I con&#383;ider all obligation as
made void by his conduct; and hold,
that &#383;chi&#383;ms which proceed from want
of principles, can never be healed.</p>

<p>"He received a fortune with me to
the amount of five thou&#383;and pounds. On
the death of my uncle, convinced that
I could provide for my child, I de&#383;troyed
the &#383;ettlement of that fortune.
I required none of my property to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-149_S" id="BPg_2-149_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-149.png">149</a>]</span>
returned to me, nor &#383;hall enumerate the
&#383;ums extorted from me during &#383;ix years
that we lived together.</p>

<p>"After leaving, what the law con&#383;iders
as my home, I was hunted like a criminal
from place to place, though I
contracted no debts, and demanded no
maintenance&mdash;yet, as the laws &#383;anction
&#383;uch proceeding, and make women the
property of their hu&#383;bands, I forbear
to animadvert. After the birth of my
daughter, and the death of my uncle,
who left a very con&#383;iderable property
to my&#383;elf and child, I was expo&#383;ed to
new per&#383;ecution; and, becau&#383;e I had,
before arriving at what is termed years
of di&#383;cretion, pledged my faith, I was
treated by the world, as bound for ever
to a man who&#383;e vices were notorious.
Yet what are the vices generally
known, to the various mi&#383;eries that a<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-150_S" id="BPg_2-150_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-150.png">150</a>]</span>
woman may be &#383;ubject to, which,
though deeply felt, eating into the
&#383;oul, elude de&#383;cription, and may be
glo&#383;&#383;ed over! A fal&#383;e morality is even
e&#383;tabli&#383;hed, which makes all the virtue
of women con&#383;i&#383;t in cha&#383;tity, &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion,
and the forgivene&#383;s of injuries.</p>

<p>"I pardon my oppre&#383;&#383;or&mdash;bitterly as I
lament the lo&#383;s of my child, torn from
me in the mo&#383;t violent manner. But
nature revolts, and my &#383;oul &#383;ickens at
the bare &#383;uppo&#383;ition, that it could ever
be a duty to pretend affection, when a
&#383;eparation is nece&#383;&#383;ary to prevent my
feeling hourly aver&#383;ion.</p>

<p>"To force me to give my fortune, I
was impri&#383;oned&mdash;yes; in a private mad-hou&#383;e.&mdash;There,
in the heart of mi&#383;ery,
I met the man charged with &#383;educing
me. We became attached&mdash;I deemed,
and ever &#383;hall deem, my&#383;elf free. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-151_S" id="BPg_2-151_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-151.png">151</a>]</span>
death of my babe di&#383;&#383;olved the only tie
which &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;ted between me and my,
what is termed, lawful hu&#383;band.</p>

<p>"To this per&#383;on, thus encountered,
I voluntarily gave my&#383;elf, never con&#383;idering
my&#383;elf as any more bound to
tran&#383;gre&#383;s the laws of moral purity,
becau&#383;e the will of my hu&#383;band
might be pleaded in my excu&#383;e, than
to tran&#383;gre&#383;s tho&#383;e laws to which
[the policy of artificial &#383;ociety has]
annexed [po&#383;itive] puni&#383;hments.&mdash;&mdash;While
no command of a hu&#383;band can
prevent a woman from &#383;uffering for
certain crimes, &#383;he mu&#383;t be allowed
to con&#383;ult her con&#383;cience, and regulate
her conduct, in &#383;ome degree, by her
own &#383;en&#383;e of right. The re&#383;pect I owe
to my&#383;elf, demanded my &#383;trict adherence
to my determination of never
viewing Mr. Venables in the light of a
hu&#383;band, nor could it forbid me from<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-152_S" id="BPg_2-152_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-152.png">152</a>]</span>
encouraging another. If I am unfortunately
united to an unprincipled man,
am I for ever to be &#383;hut out from fulfilling
the duties of a wife and mother?&mdash;I
wi&#383;h my country to approve of my
conduct; but, if laws exi&#383;t, made by
the &#383;trong to oppre&#383;s the weak, I appeal
to my own &#383;en&#383;e of ju&#383;tice, and
declare that I will not live with the
individual, who has violated every moral
obligation which binds man to man.</p>

<p>"I prote&#383;t equally again&#383;t any charge
being brought to criminate the man,
whom I con&#383;ider as my hu&#383;band. I
was &#383;ix-and-twenty when I left Mr.
Venables' roof; if ever I am to be &#383;uppo&#383;ed
to arrive at an age to direct my
own actions, I mu&#383;t by that time have
arrived at it.&mdash;I acted with deliberation.&mdash;Mr.
Darnford found me a forlorn
and oppre&#383;&#383;ed woman, and promi&#383;ed<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-153_S" id="BPg_2-153_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-153.png">153</a>]</span>
the protection women in the pre&#383;ent
&#383;tate of &#383;ociety want.&mdash;But the man
who now claims me&mdash;was he deprived
of my &#383;ociety by this conduct? The
que&#383;tion is an in&#383;ult to common &#383;en&#383;e,
con&#383;idering where Mr. Darnford met
me.&mdash;Mr. Venables' door was indeed
open to me&mdash;nay, threats and intreaties
were u&#383;ed to induce me to return; but
why? Was affection or honour the
motive?&mdash;I cannot, it is true, dive into
the rece&#383;&#383;es of the human heart&mdash;yet
I pre&#383;ume to a&#383;&#383;ert, [borne out as
I am by a variety of circum&#383;tances,]
that he was merely influenced by the
mo&#383;t rapacious avarice.</p>

<p>"I claim then a divorce, and the
liberty of enjoying, free from mole&#383;tation,
the fortune left to me by a relation,
who was well aware of the character

contend.&mdash;I appeal to the ju&#383;tice and
humanity of the jury&mdash;a body of men,
who&#383;e private judgment mu&#383;t be allowed
to modify laws, that mu&#383;t be
unju&#383;t, becau&#383;e definite rules can never
apply to indefinite circum&#383;tances&mdash;and
I deprecate puni&#383;hment upon the man
of my choice, freeing him, as I &#383;olemnly
do, from the charge of &#383;eduction.]</p>

<p>"I did not put my&#383;elf into a &#383;ituation
to ju&#383;tify a charge of adultery, till
I had, from conviction, &#383;haken off the
fetters which bound me to Mr. Venables.&mdash;While
I lived with him, I defy
the voice of calumny to &#383;ully what is
termed the fair fame of woman.&mdash;Neglected
by my hu&#383;band, I never encouraged
a lover; and pre&#383;erved with
&#383;crupulous care, what is termed my
honour, at the expence of my peace,
till he, who &#383;hould have been its guar<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-155_S" id="BPg_2-155_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-155.png">155</a>]</span>dian,
laid traps to en&#383;nare me. From
that moment I believed my&#383;elf, in the
&#383;ight of heaven, free&mdash;and no power
on earth &#383;hall force me to renounce my
re&#383;olution."</p>

<p>The judge, in &#383;umming up the evidence,
alluded to "the fallacy of letting
women plead their feelings, as an excu&#383;e
for the violation of the marriage-vow.
For his part, he had always
determined to oppo&#383;e all innovation,
and the new-fangled notions which incroached
on the good old rules of conduct.
We did not want French principles
in public or private life&mdash;and, if
women were allowed to plead their
feelings, as an excu&#383;e or palliation of
infidelity, it was opening a flood-gate
for immorality. What virtuous woman
thought of her feelings?&mdash;It was
her duty to love and obey the man<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-156_S" id="BPg_2-156_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-156.png">156</a>]</span>
cho&#383;en by her parents and relations,
who were qualified by their experience
to judge better for her, than &#383;he could
for her&#383;elf. As to the charges brought
again&#383;t the hu&#383;band, they were vague,
&#383;upported by no witne&#383;&#383;es, excepting
that of impri&#383;onment in a private mad-hou&#383;e.
The proofs of an in&#383;anity in the
family, might render that however a
prudent mea&#383;ure; and indeed the conduct
of the lady did not appear that of
a per&#383;on of &#383;ane mind. Still &#383;uch a
mode of proceeding could not be ju&#383;tified,
and might perhaps entitle the
lady [in another court] to a &#383;entence of
&#383;eparation from bed and board, during
the joint lives of the parties; but he
hoped that no Engli&#383;hman would legalize
adultery, by enabling the adultere&#383;s
to enrich her &#383;educer. Too many re&#383;trictions
could not be thrown in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-157_S" id="BPg_2-157_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-157.png">157</a>]</span>
way of divorces, if we wi&#383;hed to maintain
the &#383;anctity of marriage; and,
though they might bear a little hard on
a few, very few individuals, it was
evidently for the good of the whole."</p>

<p>"She &#383;wallowed the laudanum; her
&#383;oul was calm&mdash;the tempe&#383;t had &#383;ub<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-162_S" id="BPg_2-162_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-162.png">162</a>]</span>&#383;ided&mdash;and
nothing remained but an
eager longing to forget her&#383;elf&mdash;to
fly from the angui&#383;h &#383;he endured
to e&#383;cape from thought&mdash;from this
hell of di&#383;appointment.</p>

<p>"Still her eyes clo&#383;ed not&mdash;one remembrance
with frightful velocity followed
another&mdash;All the incidents of
her life were in arms, embodied to
a&#383;&#383;ail her, and prevent her &#383;inking
into the &#383;leep of death.&mdash;Her murdered
child again appeared to her,
mourning for the babe of which &#383;he
was the tomb.&mdash;'And could it have
a nobler?&mdash;Surely it is better to die
with me, than to enter on life without
a mother's care!&mdash;I cannot live!&mdash;but
could I have de&#383;erted my child the
moment it was born?&mdash;thrown it on
the troubled wave of life, without
a hand to &#383;upport it?'&mdash;She looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-163_S" id="BPg_2-163_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-163.png">163</a>]</span>
up: 'What have I not &#383;uffered!&mdash;may
I find a father where I am going!'&mdash;Her
head turned; a &#383;tupor en&#383;ued;
a faintne&#383;s&mdash;'Have a little patience,'
&#383;aid Maria, holding her &#383;wimming
head (&#383;he thought of her mother),
'this cannot la&#383;t long; and what is a
little bodily pain to the pangs I have
endured?'</p>

<p>"A new vi&#383;ion &#383;wam before her.
Jemima &#383;eemed to enter&mdash;leading a little
creature, that, with tottering foot&#383;teps,
approached the bed. The voice
of Jemima &#383;ounding as at a di&#383;tance,
called her&mdash;&#383;he tried to li&#383;ten, to &#383;peak,
to look!</p>

<p>"'Behold your child!' exclaimed
Jemima. Maria &#383;tarted off the bed,
and fainted.&mdash;Violent vomiting followed.</p>

<p>"When &#383;he was re&#383;tored to life, Je<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-164_S" id="BPg_2-164_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-164.png">164</a>]</span>mima
addre&#383;&#383;ed her with great &#383;olemnity:
'&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; led me to &#383;u&#383;pect,
that your hu&#383;band and brother had
deceived you, and &#383;ecreted the child.
I would not torment you with doubtful
hopes, and I left you (at a fatal
moment) to &#383;earch for the child!&mdash;I
&#383;natched her from mi&#383;ery&mdash;and (now
&#383;he is alive again) would you leave
her alone in the world, to endure what
I have endured?'</p>

<p>"Maria gazed wildly at her, her
whole frame was convul&#383;ed with emotion;
when the child, whom Jemima
had been tutoring all the journey, uttered
the word 'Mamma!' She
caught her to her bo&#383;om, and bur&#383;t
into a pa&#383;&#383;ion of tears&mdash;then, re&#383;ting
the child gently on the bed, as if
afraid of killing it,&mdash;&#383;he put her hand
to her eyes, to conceal as it were the<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-165_S" id="BPg_2-165_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-165.png">165</a>]</span>
agonizing &#383;truggle of her &#383;oul. She
remained &#383;ilent for five minutes, cro&#383;&#383;ing
her arms over her bo&#383;om, and reclining
her head,&mdash;then exclaimed:
'The conflict is over!&mdash;I will live for
my child!'"</p>

<hr />

<p>A few readers perhaps, in looking
over the&#383;e hints, will wonder how it
could have been practicable, without
tediou&#383;ne&#383;s, or remitting in any degree
the intere&#383;t of the &#383;tory, to have filled,
from the&#383;e &#383;light &#383;ketches, a number of
pages, more con&#383;iderable than tho&#383;e
which have been already pre&#383;ented.
But, in reality, the&#383;e hints, &#383;imple as
they are, are pregnant with pa&#383;&#383;ion and
di&#383;tre&#383;s. It is the refuge of barren au<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-166_S" id="BPg_2-166_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-166.png">166</a>]</span>thors
only, to crowd their fictions with
&#383;o great a number of events, as to &#383;uffer
no one of them to &#383;ink into the reader's
mind. It is the province of true genius
to develop events, to di&#383;cover their
capabilities, to a&#383;certain the different
pa&#383;&#383;ions and &#383;entiments with which they
are fraught, and to diver&#383;ify them with
incidents, that give reality to the picture,
and take a hold upon the mind of a
reader of ta&#383;te, from which they can
never be loo&#383;ened. It was particularly
the de&#383;ign of the author, in the pre&#383;ent
in&#383;tance, to make her &#383;tory &#383;ubordinate
to a great moral purpo&#383;e, that "of exhibiting
the mi&#383;ery and oppre&#383;&#383;ion, peculiar
to women, that ari&#383;e out of the
partial laws and cu&#383;toms of &#383;ociety.&mdash;This
view re&#383;trained her fancy<a name="BFNanchor_166-A_10_S" id="BFNanchor_166-A_10_S"></a><a href="#BFootnote_166-A_10_S" class="fnanchor">[166-A]</a>." It<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-167_S" id="BPg_2-167_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-167.png">167</a>]</span>
was nece&#383;&#383;ary for her, to place in a &#383;triking
point of view, evils that are too
frequently overlooked, and to drag into
light tho&#383;e details of oppre&#383;&#383;ion, of
which the gro&#383;&#383;er and more in&#383;en&#383;ible
part of mankind make little account.</p>

<h3>BY THE EDITOR.</h3>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following pages will, I believe,
be judged by every reader of ta&#383;te to
have been worth pre&#383;erving, among
the other te&#383;timonies the author left

&#383;oundne&#383;s of her under&#383;tanding. To<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-172_S" id="BPg_2-172_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-172.png">172</a>]</span>
&#383;uch readers I leave the ta&#383;k of comparing
the&#383;e le&#383;&#383;ons, with other works
of the &#383;ame nature previou&#383;ly publi&#383;hed.
It is obvious that the author has &#383;truck
out a path of her own, and by no means
intrenched upon the plans of her predece&#383;&#383;ors.</p>

<p>It may however excite &#383;urpri&#383;e in
&#383;ome per&#383;ons to find the&#383;e papers annexed
to the conclu&#383;ion of a novel. All
I have to offer on this &#383;ubject, con&#383;i&#383;ts
in the following con&#383;iderations:</p>

<p>Fir&#383;t, &#383;omething is to be allowed for
the difficulty of arranging the mi&#383;cellaneous
papers upon very different &#383;ub<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-173_S" id="BPg_2-173_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-173.png">173</a>]</span>jects,
which will frequently con&#383;titute
an author's po&#383;thumous works.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Secondly, the &#383;mall portion they occupy
in the pre&#383;ent volume, will perhaps
be accepted as an apology, by
&#383;uch good-natured readers (if any &#383;uch
there are), to whom the peru&#383;al of
them &#383;hall be a matter of perfect indifference.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Thirdly, the circum&#383;tance which
determined me in annexing them to
the pre&#383;ent work, was the &#383;light a&#383;&#383;ociation
(in default of a &#383;trong one)
between the affectionate and pathetic
manner in which Maria Venables ad<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-174_S" id="BPg_2-174_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-174.png">174</a>]</span>dre&#383;&#383;es
her infant, in the Wrongs of
Woman; and the agoni&#383;ing and painful

originally bequeathed the&#383;e papers, as

He is forced to lie on his back, if his
mamma do not turn him to the right or
left &#383;ide, he will &#383;oon begin to cry.
He cries to tell her, that he is tired
with lying on his back.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON VI.</p>

<p>PERHAPS he is hungry. What
&#383;hall we give him to eat? Poor fellow,
he cannot eat. Look in his mouth, he
has no teeth.</p>

<p>How did you do when you were a baby
like him? You cannot tell. Do you
want to know? Look then at the dog,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-181_S" id="BPg_2-181_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-181.png">181</a>]</span>
with her pretty puppy. You could
not help your&#383;elf as well as the puppy.
You could only open your mouth,
when you were lying, like William, on
my knee. So I put you to my brea&#383;t,
and you &#383;ucked, as the puppy &#383;ucks
now, for there was milk enough for
you.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON VII.</p>

<p>WHEN you were hungry, you began
to cry, becau&#383;e you could not &#383;peak.
You were &#383;even months without teeth,
always &#383;ucking. But after you got
one, you began to gnaw a cru&#383;t of
bread. It was not long before another
came pop. At ten months you had
four pretty white teeth, and you u&#383;ed
to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did
not cry, becau&#383;e I am not a child, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-182_S" id="BPg_2-182_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-182.png">182</a>]</span>
you hurt me very much. So I &#383;aid to
papa, it is time the little girl &#383;hould
eat. She is not naughty, yet &#383;he hurts
me. I have given her a cru&#383;t of bread,
and I mu&#383;t look for &#383;ome other milk.</p>

<p>The cow has got plenty, and her
jumping calf eats gra&#383;s very well. He
has got more teeth than my little girl.
Yes, &#383;ays papa, and he tapped you on
the cheek, you are old enough to learn
to eat? Come to me, and I will teach
you, my little dear, for you mu&#383;t not
hurt poor mamma, who has given you
her milk, when you could not take any
thing el&#383;e.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON VIII.</p>

<p>YOU were then on the carpet, for
you could not walk well. So when
you were in a hurry, you u&#383;ed to run<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-183_S" id="BPg_2-183_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-183.png">183</a>]</span>
quick, quick, quick, on your hands
and feet, like the dog.</p>

<p>Away you ran to papa, and putting
both your arms round his leg, for your
hands were not big enough, you looked
up at him, and laughed. What did
this laugh &#383;ay, when you could not
&#383;peak? Cannot you gue&#383;s by what you
now &#383;ay to papa?&mdash;Ah! it was, Play
with me, papa!&mdash;play with me!</p>

<p>Papa began to &#383;mile, and you knew
that the &#383;mile was always&mdash;Yes. So
you got a ball, and papa threw it along
the floor&mdash;Roll&mdash;roll&mdash;roll; and you
ran after it again&mdash;and again. How
plea&#383;ed you were. Look at William,
he &#383;miles; but you could laugh loud&mdash;Ha!
ha! ha!&mdash;Papa laughed louder
than the little girl, and rolled the ball
&#383;till fa&#383;ter.</p>

<p>Then he put the ball on a chair, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-184_S" id="BPg_2-184_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-184.png">184</a>]</span>
you were forced to take hold of the
back, and &#383;tand up to reach it. At
la&#383;t you reached too far, and down you
fell: not indeed on your face, becau&#383;e
you put out your hands. You were not
much hurt; but the palms of your
hands &#383;marted with the pain, and you
began to cry, like a little child.</p>

<p>It is only very little children who cry
when they are hurt; and it is to tell
their mamma, that &#383;omething is the
matter with them. Now you can come
to me, and &#383;ay, Mamma, I have hurt
my&#383;elf. Pray rub my hand: it &#383;marts.
Put &#383;omething on it, to make it well.
A piece of rag, to &#383;top the blood.
You are not afraid of a little blood&mdash;not
you. You &#383;cratched your arm with
a pin: it bled a little; but it did you
no harm. See, the &#383;kin is grown over
it again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-185_S" id="BPg_2-185_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-185.png">185</a>]</span></p>
<p class="center">LESSON IX.</p>

<p>TAKE care not to put pins in your
mouth, becau&#383;e they will &#383;tick in your
throat, and give you pain. Oh! you
cannot think what pain a pin would
give you in your throat, &#383;hould it remain
there: but, if you by chance
&#383;wallow it, I &#383;hould be obliged to give
you, every morning, &#383;omething bitter
to drink. You never ta&#383;ted any thing
&#383;o bitter! and you would grow very
&#383;ick. I never put pins in my mouth;
but I am older than you, and know how
to take care of my&#383;elf.</p>

<p>My mamma took care of me, when I
was a little girl, like you. She bade
me never put any thing in my mouth,
without a&#383;king her what it was.</p>

<p>When you were a baby, with no more<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-186_S" id="BPg_2-186_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-186.png">186</a>]</span>
&#383;en&#383;e than William, you put every thing
in your mouth to gnaw, to help your
teeth to cut through the &#383;kin. Look
at the puppy, how he bites that piece
of wood. William pre&#383;&#383;es his gums
again&#383;t my finger. Poor boy! he is &#383;o
young, he does not know what he is
doing. When you bite any thing, it is
becau&#383;e you are hungry.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON X.</p>

<p>SEE how much taller you are than
William. In four years you have learned
to eat, to walk, to talk. Why do you
&#383;mile? You can do much more, you
think: you can wa&#383;h your hands and
face. Very well. I &#383;hould never ki&#383;s
a dirty face. And you can comb your
head with the pretty comb you always<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-187_S" id="BPg_2-187_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-187.png">187</a>]</span>
put by in your own drawer. To be
&#383;ure, you do all this to be ready to take
a walk with me. You would be obliged
to &#383;tay at home, if you could not comb
your own hair. Betty is bu&#383;y getting
the dinner ready, and only bru&#383;hes
William's hair, becau&#383;e he cannot do it
for him&#383;elf.</p>

<p>Betty is making an apple-pye. You
love an apple-pye; but I do not bid
you make one. Your hands are not
&#383;trong enough to mix the butter and
flour together; and you mu&#383;t not try to
pare the apples, becau&#383;e you cannot
manage a great knife.</p>

<p>Never touch the large knives: they
are very &#383;harp, and you might cut your
finger to the bone. You are a little
girl, and ought to have a little knife.
When you are as tall as I am, you &#383;hall
have a knife as large as mine; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-188_S" id="BPg_2-188_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-188.png">188</a>]</span>
when you are as &#383;trong as I am, and
have learned to manage it, you will not
hurt your&#383;elf.</p>

<p>You can trundle a hoop, you &#383;ay;
and jump over a &#383;tick. O, I forgot!&mdash;and
march like the men in the red
coats, when papa plays a pretty tune on
the fiddle.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON XI.</p>

<p>WHAT, you think that you &#383;hall
&#383;oon be able to dre&#383;s your&#383;elf entirely?
I am glad of it: I have &#383;omething el&#383;e
to do. You may go, and look for your
frock in the drawer; but I will tie it,
till you are &#383;tronger. Betty will tie it,
when I am bu&#383;y.</p>

<p>I button my gown my&#383;elf: I do not
want a maid to a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t me, when I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-189_S" id="BPg_2-189_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-189.png">189</a>]</span>
dre&#383;&#383;ing. But you have not yet got
&#383;en&#383;e enough to do it properly, and
mu&#383;t beg &#383;omebody to help you, till you
are older.</p>

<p>Children grow older and wi&#383;er at the
&#383;ame time. William is not able to take
a piece of meat, becau&#383;e he has not got
the &#383;en&#383;e which would make him think
that, without teeth, meat would do him
harm. He cannot tell what is good for
him.</p>

<p>The &#383;en&#383;e of children grows with
them. You know much more than
William, now you walk alone, and talk;
but you do not know as much as the
boys and girls you &#383;ee playing yonder,
who are half as tall again as you; and
they do not know half as much as their
fathers and mothers, who are men and
women grown. Papa and I were children,
like you; and men and women<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-190_S" id="BPg_2-190_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-190.png">190</a>]</span>
took care of us. I carry William, becau&#383;e
he is too weak to walk. I lift
you over a &#383;tile, and over the gutter,
when you cannot jump over it.</p>

<p>You know already, that potatoes
will not do you any harm: but I mu&#383;t
pluck the fruit for you, till you are wi&#383;e
enough to know the ripe apples and
pears. The hard ones would make you
&#383;ick, and then you mu&#383;t take phy&#383;ic.
You do not love phy&#383;ic: I do not love
it any more than you. But I have more
&#383;en&#383;e than you; therefore I take care
not to eat unripe fruit, or any thing el&#383;e
that would make my &#383;tomach ache, or
bring out ugly red &#383;pots on my face.</p>

<p>When I was a child, my mamma
cho&#383;e the fruit for me, to prevent my
making my&#383;elf &#383;ick. I was ju&#383;t like
you; I u&#383;ed to a&#383;k for what I &#383;aw, without
knowing whether it was good or<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-191_S" id="BPg_2-191_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-191.png">191</a>]</span>
bad. Now I have lived a long time, I
know what is good; I do not want any
body to tell me.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON XII.</p>

<p>LOOK at tho&#383;e two dogs. The old
one brings the ball to me in a moment;
the young one does not know how.
He mu&#383;t be taught.</p>

<p>I can cut your &#383;hift in a proper &#383;hape.
You would not know how to begin.
You would &#383;poil it; but you will learn.</p>

<p>John digs in the garden, and knows
when to put the &#383;eed in the ground.
You cannot tell whether it &#383;hould be in
the winter or &#383;ummer. Try to find it
out. When do the trees put out their
leaves? In the &#383;pring, you &#383;ay, after the<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-192_S" id="BPg_2-192_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-192.png">192</a>]</span>
cold weather. Fruit would not grow
ripe without very warm weather. Now
I am &#383;ure you can gue&#383;s why the &#383;ummer
is the &#383;ea&#383;on for fruit.</p>

<p>Papa knows that peas and beans are
good for us to eat with our meat. You
are glad when you &#383;ee them; but if he
did not think for you, and have the
&#383;eed put in the ground, we &#383;hould have
no peas or beans.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON XIII.</p>

<p>POOR child, &#383;he cannot do much for
her&#383;elf. When I let her do any thing
for me, it is to plea&#383;e her: for I could
do it better my&#383;elf.</p>

<p>Oh! the poor puppy has tumbled
off the &#383;tool. Run and &#383;troak him. Put<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-193_S" id="BPg_2-193_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-193.png">193</a>]</span>
a little milk in a &#383;aucer to comfort him.
You have more &#383;en&#383;e than he. You
can pour the milk into the &#383;aucer without
&#383;pilling it. He would cry for a day
with hunger, without being able to get
it. You are wi&#383;er than the dog, you
mu&#383;t help him. The dog will love you
for it, and run after you. I feed you
and take care of you: you love me
and follow me for it.</p>

<p>When the book fell down on your
foot, it gave you great pain. The poor
dog felt the &#383;ame pain ju&#383;t now.</p>

<p>Take care not to hurt him when you
play with him. And every morning
leave a little milk in your ba&#383;on for
him. Do not forget to put the ba&#383;on
in a corner, le&#383;t &#383;omebody &#383;hould fall
over it.</p>

<p>When the &#383;now covers the ground,
&#383;ave the crumbs of bread for the birds.
In the &#383;ummer they find feed enough,<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-194_S" id="BPg_2-194_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-194.png">194</a>]</span>
and do not want you to think about
them.</p>

<p>I make broth for the poor man who
is &#383;ick. A &#383;ick man is like a child, he
cannot help him&#383;elf.</p>


<p class="center">LESSON X.</p>

<p>WHEN I caught cold &#383;ome time
ago, I had &#383;uch a pain in my head, I
could &#383;carcely hold it up. Papa
opened the door very &#383;oftly, becau&#383;e
he loves me. You love me, yet you
made a noi&#383;e. You had not the &#383;en&#383;e
to know that it made my head wor&#383;e,
till papa told you.</p>

<p>Papa had a pain in the &#383;tomach, and
he would not eat the fine cherries or
grapes on the table. When I brought
him a cup of camomile tea, he drank
it without &#383;aying a word, or making<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-195_S" id="BPg_2-195_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-195.png">195</a>]</span>
an ugly face. He knows that I love
him, and that I would not give him
any thing to drink that has a bad ta&#383;te,
if it were not to do him good.</p>

<p>You a&#383;ked me for &#383;ome apples when
your &#383;tomach ached; but I was not angry
with you. If you had been as wi&#383;e
as papa, you would have &#383;aid, I will
not eat the apples to-day, I mu&#383;t take
&#383;ome camomile tea.</p>

<p>You &#383;ay that you do not know how
to think. Yes; you do a little. The
other day papa was tired; he had been
walking about all the morning. After
dinner he fell a&#383;leep on the &#383;opha. I
did not bid you be quiet; but you
thought of what papa &#383;aid to you,
when my head ached. This made you
think that you ought not to make a
noi&#383;e, when papa was re&#383;ting him&#383;elf.
So you came to me, and &#383;aid to me,
very &#383;oftly, Pray reach me my ball, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="BPg_2-196_S" id="BPg_2-196_S"></a>[<a href="images/v2-196.png">196</a>]</span>
I will go and play in the garden, till
papa wakes.</p>

<p>You were going out; but thinking
again, you came back to me on your
tip-toes. Whi&#383;per&mdash;&mdash;whi&#383;per. Pray
mama, call me, when papa wakes;
for I &#383;hall be afraid to open the door
to &#383;ee, le&#383;t I &#383;hould di&#383;turb him.</p>

<p>Away you went.&mdash;Creep&mdash;creep&mdash;and
&#383;hut the door as &#383;oftly as I could
have done my&#383;elf.</p>

<p>That was thinking. When a child
does wrong at fir&#383;t, &#383;he does not know
any better. But, after &#383;he has been told
that &#383;he mu&#383;t not di&#383;turb mama, when
poor mama is unwell, &#383;he thinks her&#383;elf,
that &#383;he mu&#383;t not wake papa when
he is tired.</p>

<p>Another day we will &#383;ee if you can
think about any thing el&#383;e.</p>

<h2><a name="CV3_PREFACE" id="CV3_PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following Letters may possibly
be found to contain the finest examples
of the language of sentiment and
passion ever presented to the world.
They bear a striking resemblance to
the celebrated romance of Werter,
though the incidents to which they relate
are of a very different cast. Probably
the readers to whom Werter
is incapable of affording pleasure, will
receive no delight from the present
publication. The editor apprehends<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-vii" id="CPg_3-vii"></a>[<a href="images/v3-vii.png">vii</a>]</span>
that, in the judgment of those best
qualified to decide upon the comparison,
these Letters will be admitted to
have the superiority over the fiction of
Goethe. They are the offspring of a
glowing imagination, and a heart penetrated
with the passion it essays to describe.</p>

<p>To the series of letters constituting
the principal article in these two volumes,
are added various pieces, none
of which, it is hoped, will be found
discreditable to the talents of the author.
The slight fragment of Letters on
the Management of Infants, may be
thought a trifle; but it seems to have
some value, as presenting to us with
vividness the intention of the writer on<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-viii" id="CPg_3-viii"></a>[<a href="images/v3-viii.png">viii</a>]</span>
this important subject. The publication
of a few select Letters to Mr.
Johnson, appeared to be at once a just
monument to the sincerity of his friendship,
and a valuable and interesting
specimen of the mind of the writer.
The Letter on the Present Character
of the French Nation, the Extract of
the Cave of Fancy, a Tale, and the
Hints for the Second Part of the Rights
of Woman, may, I believe, safely be
left to speak for themselves. The Essay
on Poetry and our Relish for the Beauties
of Nature, appeared in the Monthly
Magazine for April last, and is the
only piece in this collection which has
previously found its way to the press.</p>

<h4>LETTER I</h4>

<p class="right">Two o'Clock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> dear love, after making my
arrangements for our snug dinner to-day,
I have been taken by storm,
and obliged to promise to dine, at
an early hour, with the Miss &mdash;&mdash;s,
the <i>only</i> day they intend to pass here.
I shall however leave the key in the
door, and hope to find you at my

<h4>LETTER IV<a name="FNanchor_7-A_13" id="CFNanchor_7-A_13"></a><a href="#CFootnote_7-A_13" class="fnanchor">[7-A]</a>.</h4>

<p class="right">Friday Morning [September.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A man</span>, whom a letter from Mr. &mdash;&mdash;
previously announced, called here yesterday
for the payment of a draft; and,
as he seemed disappointed at not finding
you at home, I sent him to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;.
I have since seen him, and he tells me
that he has settled the business.</p>

<p>So much for business!&mdash;May I venture
to talk a little longer about less
weighty affairs?&mdash;How are you?&mdash;I<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-8" id="CPg_3-8"></a>[<a href="images/v3-8.png">8</a>]</span>
have been following you all along the
road this comfortless weather; for,
when I am absent from those I love, my
imagination is as lively, as if my senses
had never been gratified by their presence&mdash;I
was going to say caresses&mdash;and
why should I not? I have found out
that I have more mind than you, in one
respect; because I can, without any
violent effort of reason, find food for
love in the same object, much longer
than you can.&mdash;The way to my senses
is through my heart; but, forgive me!
I think there is sometimes a shorter cut
to yours.</p>

<p>With ninety-nine men out of a hundred,
a very sufficient dash of folly is
necessary to render a woman <i>piquante</i>, a
soft word for desirable; and, beyond
these casual ebullitions of sympathy,
few look for enjoyment by fostering a<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-9" id="CPg_3-9"></a>[<a href="images/v3-9.png">9</a>]</span>
passion in their hearts. One reason, in
short, why I wish my whole sex to become
wiser, is, that the foolish ones
may not, by their pretty folly, rob those
whose sensibility keeps down their vanity,
of the few roses that afford them
some solace in the thorny road of life.</p>

<p>I do not know how I fell into these
reflections, excepting one thought produced
it&mdash;that these continual separations
were necessary to warm your affection.&mdash;Of
late, we are always separating.&mdash;Crack!&mdash;crack!&mdash;and away
you go.&mdash;This joke wears the sallow
cast of thought; for, though I began to
write cheerfully, some melancholy tears
have found their way into my eyes, that
linger there, whilst a glow of tenderness
at my heart whispers that you are one
of the best creatures in the world.&mdash;Pardon
then the vagaries of a mind,<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-10" id="CPg_3-10"></a>[<a href="images/v3-10.png">10</a>]</span>
that has been almost "crazed by care,"
as well as "crossed in hapless love,"
and bear with me a <i>little</i> longer!&mdash;When
we are settled in the country together,
more duties will open before me, and
my heart, which now, trembling into
peace, is agitated by every emotion that
awakens the remembrance of old griefs,
will learn to rest on yours, with that
dignity your character, not to talk of
my own, demands.</p>

<p>Take care of yourself&mdash;and write
soon to your own girl (you may add
dear, if you please) who sincerely loves
you, and will try to convince you of it,
by becoming happier.</p>

can be unreasonable, as well as myself&mdash;for
be it known to thee, that I answered
thy <i>first</i> letter, the very night it
reached me (Sunday), though thou
couldst not receive it before Wednesday,
because it was not sent off till the
next day.&mdash;There is a full, true, and
particular account.&mdash;</p>

<p>Yet I am not angry with thee, my
love, for I think that it is a proof of
stupidity, and likewise of a milk-and-water
affection, which comes to the
same thing, when the temper is governed
by a square and compass.&mdash;There is
nothing picturesque in this straight-<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-15" id="CPg_3-15"></a>[<a href="images/v3-15.png">15</a>]</span>lined
equality, and the passions always
give grace to the actions.</p>

<p>Recollection now makes my heart
bound to thee; but, it is not to thy
money-getting face, though I cannot
be seriously displeased with the exertion
which increases my esteem, or
rather is what I should have expected
from thy character.&mdash;No; I have thy
honest countenance before me&mdash;Pop&mdash;relaxed
by tenderness; a little&mdash;little
wounded by my whims; and thy eyes
glistening with sympathy.&mdash;Thy lips
then feel softer than soft&mdash;and I rest my
cheek on thine, forgetting all the
world.&mdash;I have not left the hue of love
out of the picture&mdash;the rosy glow; and

grateful emotion directed to the Father

alive to happiness, did not give more
warmth to the sentiment it divides&mdash;I
must pause a moment.</p>

<p>Need I tell you that I am tranquil
after writing thus?&mdash;I do not know
why, but I have more confidence in
your affection, when absent, than present;
nay, I think that you must love
me, for, in the sincerity of my heart
let me say it, I believe I deserve your
tenderness, because I am true, and
have a degree of sensibility that you
can see and relish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> I have been, you tell me, three
days without writing, I ought not to
complain of two: yet, as I expected to
receive a letter this afternoon, I am
hurt; and why should I, by concealing
it, affect the heroism I do not feel?</p>

<p>I hate commerce. How differently
must &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s head and heart be organized
from mine! You will tell me,
that exertions are necessary: I am
weary of them! The face of things,
public and private, vexes me. The
"peace" and clemency which seemed
to be dawning a few days ago, disappear
again. "I am fallen," as Milton said,
"on evil days;" for I really believe<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-25" id="CPg_3-25"></a>[<a href="images/v3-25.png">25</a>]</span>
that Europe will be in a state of convulsion,
during half a century at least.
Life is but a labour of patience: it is

for, before a person can find a resting-place,
imagining it is lodged, down it
comes again, and all the work is to be
done over anew!</p>

I could not change the strain. My head
aches, and my heart is heavy. The
world appears an "unweeded garden,"
where "things rank and vile" flourish

nay, all the world, may know it for
aught I care!&mdash;Yet I wish to avoid

<p>Considering the care and anxiety a
woman must have about a child before
it comes into the world, it seems to
me, by a <i>natural right</i>, to belong to
her. When men get immersed in the
world, they seem to lose all sensations,
excepting those necessary to continue or

<h4>LETTER XI</h4>

<p class="right">Monday Night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> just received your kind and
rational letter, and would fain hide my
face, glowing with shame for my folly.&mdash;I
would hide it in your bosom, if you
would again open it to me, and nestle
closely till you bade my fluttering
heart be still, by saying that you forgave
me. With eyes overflowing with
tears, and in the humblest attitude, I
intreat you.&mdash;Do not turn from me, for
indeed I love you fondly, and have been
very wretched, since the night I was so
cruelly hurt by thinking that you had
no confidence in me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It is time for me to grow more reasonable,
a few more of these caprices
of sensibility would destroy me. I have,<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-29" id="CPg_3-29"></a>[<a href="images/v3-29.png">29</a>]</span>
in fact, been very much indisposed for
a few days past, and the notion that I
was tormenting, or perhaps killing, a
poor little animal, about whom I am
grown anxious and tender, now I feel
it alive, made me worse. My bowels
have been dreadfully disordered, and
every thing I ate or drank disagreed
with my stomach; still I feel intimations
of its existence, though they have been
fainter.</p>

<p>Do you think that the creature goes
regularly to sleep? I am ready to ask as
many questions as Voltaire's Man of
Forty Crowns. Ah! do not continue to
be angry with me! You perceive that I
am already smiling through my tears&mdash;You
have lightened my heart, and my
frozen spirits are melting into playfulness.</p>

<p>Write the moment you receive this.<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-30" id="CPg_3-30"></a>[<a href="images/v3-30.png">30</a>]</span>
I shall count the minutes. But drop
not an angry word&mdash;I cannot now bear
it. Yet, if you think I deserve a scolding
(it does not admit of a question, I
grant), wait till you come back&mdash;and
then, if you are angry one day, I shall
be sure of seeing you the next.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; did not write to you, I suppose,
because he talked of going to
H&mdash;&mdash;. Hearing that I was ill, he called
very kindly on me, not dreaming that
it was some words that he incautiously
let fall, which rendered me so.</p>

<p>God bless you, my love; do not shut
your heart against a return of tenderness;
and, as I now in fancy cling to
you, be more than ever my support.&mdash;Feel
but as affectionate when you read
this letter, as I did writing it, and you
will make happy, your</p>

<p class="right">Wednesday Morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I will</span> never, if I am not entirely
cured of quarrelling, begin to encourage
"quick-coming fancies," when
we are separated. Yesterday, my love,
I could not open your letter for some
time; and, though it was not half as
severe as I merited, it threw me into
such a fit of trembling, as seriously
alarmed me. I did not, as you may
suppose, care for a little pain on my
own account; but all the fears which
I have had for a few days past, returned
with fresh force. This morning I am
better; will you not be glad to hear it?
You perceive that sorrow has almost
made a child of me, and that I want to
be soothed to peace.</p>

and imagine that to be coldness
which is just the contrary. For, when
I am hurt by the person most dear to
me, I must let out a whole torrent of
emotions, in which tenderness would
be uppermost, or stifle them altogether;
and it appears to me almost a duty to
stifle them, when I imagine <i>that I am
treated with coldness</i>.</p>

<p>I am afraid that I have vexed you,
my own &mdash;&mdash;. I know the quickness
of your feelings&mdash;and let me, in the
sincerity of my heart, assure you, there
is nothing I would not suffer to make
you happy. My own happiness wholly
depends on you&mdash;and, knowing you,
when my reason is not clouded, I look
forward to a rational prospect of as much
felicity as the earth affords&mdash;with a little
dash of rapture into the bargain, if
you will look at me, when we meet<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-33" id="CPg_3-33"></a>[<a href="images/v3-33.png">33</a>]</span>

seemed to me a want of confidence, and
consequently affection.&mdash;I thought also,

been with you.&mdash;Well! well, what signifies

was instantly at work, and I found my
head on your shoulder, whilst my eyes
were fixed on the little creatures that
were clinging about your knees. I did
not absolutely determine that there
should be six&mdash;if you have not set your
heart on this round number.</p>

<p>I am going to dine with Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;.

you to my breast, I have to my heart.&mdash;I
am afraid to read over this prattle&mdash;but

you left us. I think I shall enjoy the
fine prospect, and that it will rather
enliven, than satiate my imagination.</p>

<p>I have called on Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. She
has the manners of a gentlewoman,
with a dash of the easy French coquetry,
which renders her <i>piquante</i>.&mdash;But <i>Monsieur</i>
her husband, whom nature never
dreamed of casting in either the mould
of a gentleman or lover, makes but an
aukward figure in the foreground of
the picture.</p>

<p>The H&mdash;&mdash;s are very ugly, without
doubt&mdash;and the house smelt of commerce
from top to toe&mdash;so that his
abortive attempt to display taste, only
proved it to be one of the things not to
be bought with gold. I was in a room
a moment alone, and my attention was
attracted by the <i>pendule</i>&mdash;A nymph was<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-49" id="CPg_3-49"></a>[<a href="images/v3-49.png">49</a>]</span>
offering up her vows before a smoking
altar, to a fat-bottomed Cupid (saving
your presence), who was kicking his
heels in the air.&mdash;Ah! kick on, thought
I; for the demon of traffic will ever
fright away the loves and graces, that
streak with the rosy beams of infant
fancy the <i>sombre</i> day of life&mdash;whilst the
imagination, not allowing us to see
things as they are, enables us to catch
a hasty draught of the running stream
of delight, the thirst for which seems to
be given only to tantalize us.</p>

<p>But I am philosophizing; nay, perhaps
you will call me severe, and bid
me let the square-headed money-getters
alone.&mdash;Peace to them! though none
of the social sprites (and there are not a
few of different descriptions, who sport
about the various inlets to my heart)
gave me a twitch to restrain my pen.</p>

poor &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; to come; for, when I
began, I merely thought of business;

is scarcely worth having, even with a

thereunto, I will allow you to cultivate
my judgment, if you will permit me to
keep alive the sentiments in your heart,

me clearly mutual, I shall labour only
to esteem your character, instead of
cherishing a tenderness for your person.</p>

<p>I write in a hurry, because the little
one, who has been sleeping a long time,
begins to call for me. Poor thing!
when I am sad, I lament that all my
affections grow on me, till they become
too strong for my peace, though they
all afford me snatches of exquisite enjoyment&mdash;This
for our little girl was at
first very reasonable&mdash;more the effect
of reason, a sense of duty, than feeling&mdash;now,
she has got into my heart
and imagination, and when I walk out
without her, her little figure is ever
dancing before me.</p>

<p>You too have somehow clung round
my heart&mdash;I found I could not eat my<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-54" id="CPg_3-54"></a>[<a href="images/v3-54.png">54</a>]</span>
dinner in the great room&mdash;and, when
I took up the large knife to carve for
myself, tears rushed into my eyes.&mdash;Do
not however suppose that I am melancholy&mdash;for,
when you are from me,
I not only wonder how I can find fault
with you&mdash;but how I can doubt your
affection.</p>

<p>I will not mix any comments on the
inclosed (it roused my indignation)
with the effusion of tenderness, with
which I assure you, that you are the
friend of my bosom, and the prop of my
heart.</p>

<h4>LETTER XXII</h4>

<p class="right">H&mdash;, August 20.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I want</span> to know what steps you
have taken respecting &mdash;&mdash;. Knavery
always rouses my indignation&mdash;I should
be gratified to hear that the law had
chastised &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; severely; but I do not
wish you to see him, because the business
does not now admit of peaceful
discussion, and I do not exactly know
how you would express your contempt.</p>

<p>Pray ask some questions about Tallien&mdash;I
am still pleased with the dignity
of his conduct.&mdash;The other day, in the
cause of humanity, he made use of a
degree of address, which I admire<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-56" id="CPg_3-56"></a>[<a href="images/v3-56.png">56</a>]</span>&mdash;and
mean to point out to you, as one
of the few instances of address which
do credit to the abilities of the man,
without taking away from that confidence
in his openness of heart, which
is the true basis of both public and
private friendship.</p>

<p>Do not suppose that I mean to allude
to a little reserve of temper in you,
of which I have sometimes complained!
You have been used to a
cunning woman, and you almost look
for cunning&mdash;Nay, in <i>managing</i> my
happiness, you now and then wounded
my sensibility, concealing yourself, till
honest sympathy, giving you to me
without disguise, lets me look into a
heart, which my half-broken one wishes
to creep into, to be revived and
cherished.&mdash;&mdash;You have frankness of
heart, but not often exactly that over<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-57" id="CPg_3-57"></a>[<a href="images/v3-57.png">57</a>]</span>flowing
(<i>&eacute;panchement de c&oelig;ur</i>), which
becoming almost childish, appears a
weakness only to the weak.</p>

<p>But I have left poor Tallien. I
wanted you to enquire likewise whether,
as a member declared in the convention,
Robespierre really maintained
a <i>number</i> of mistresses.&mdash;Should it prove
so, I suspect that they rather flattered
his vanity than his senses.</p>

<p>Here is a chatting, desultory epistle!
But do not suppose that I mean to
close it without mentioning the little
damsel&mdash;who has been almost springing
out of my arm&mdash;she certainly looks
very like you&mdash;but I do not love her
the less for that, whether I am angry
or pleased with you.&mdash;</p>

<h4>LETTER XXIII<a name="FNanchor_58-A_17" id="CFNanchor_58-A_17"></a><a href="#CFootnote_58-A_17" class="fnanchor">[58-A]</a>.</h4>

<p class="right">September 22.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> just written two letters, that
are going by other conveyances, and
which I reckon on your receiving long
before this. I therefore merely write,
because I know I should be disappointed
at seeing any one who had left you,
if you did not send a letter, were it ever
so short, to tell me why you did not
write a longer&mdash;and you will want to
be told, over and over again, that our
little Hercules is quite recovered.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-59" id="CPg_3-59"></a>[<a href="images/v3-59.png">59</a>]</span></p>
<p>Besides looking at me, there are
three other things, which delight her&mdash;to
ride in a coach, to look at a scarlet
waistcoat, and hear loud music&mdash;yesterday,
at the <i>f&ecirc;te</i>, she enjoyed the two
latter; but, to honour J. J. Rousseau,
I intend to give her a sash, the first she
has ever had round her&mdash;and why not?&mdash;for
I have always been half in love
with him.</p>

<p>Well, this you will say is trifling&mdash;shall
I talk about alum or soap? There
is nothing picturesque in your present
pursuits; my imagination then rather
chuses to ramble back to the barrier
with you, or to see you coming to
meet me, and my basket of grapes.&mdash;With
what pleasure do I recollect your
looks and words, when I have been
sitting on the window, regarding the
waving corn!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-60" id="CPg_3-60"></a>[<a href="images/v3-60.png">60</a>]</span>
Believe me, sage sir, you have not
sufficient respect for the imagination&mdash;I
could prove to you in a trice that it is
the mother of sentiment, the great
distinction of our nature, the only purifier
of the passions&mdash;animals have a
portion of reason, and equal, if not
more exquisite, senses; but no trace of
imagination, or her offspring taste, appears
in any of their actions. The impulse
of the senses, passions, if you will,
and the conclusions of reason, draw
men together; but the imagination is
the true fire, stolen from heaven, to
animate this cold creature of clay, producing
all those fine sympathies that
lead to rapture, rendering men social
by expanding their hearts, instead of
leaving them leisure to calculate how
many comforts society affords.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-61" id="CPg_3-61"></a>[<a href="images/v3-61.png">61</a>]</span>
If you call these observations romantic,
a phrase in this place which would
be tantamount to nonsensical, I shall
be apt to retort, that you are embruted
by trade, and the vulgar enjoyments of
life&mdash;Bring me then back your barrier-face,
or you shall have nothing to say
to my barrier-girl; and I shall fly from
you, to cherish the remembrances that
will ever be dear to me; for I am
yours truly</p>

<h4>LETTER XXIV</h4>

<p class="right">Evening, Sept. 23.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> been playing and laughing
with the little girl so long, that I cannot
take up my pen to address you
without emotion. Pressing her to my
bosom, she looked so like you (<i>entre
nous</i>, your best looks, for I do not admire
your commercial face) every nerve
seemed to vibrate to the touch, and I
began to think that there was something
in the assertion of man and wife
being one&mdash;for you seemed to pervade
my whole frame, quickening the beat
of my heart, and lending me the sympathetic
tears you excited.</p>

<p>Have I any thing more to say to you?
No; not for the present&mdash;the rest is all<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-63" id="CPg_3-63"></a>[<a href="images/v3-63.png">63</a>]</span>
flown away; and, indulging tenderness
for you, I cannot now complain of
some people here, who have ruffled my
temper for two or three days past.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="right">Morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yesterday</span> B&mdash;&mdash; sent to me for
my packet of letters. He called on me
before; and I like him better than I
did&mdash;that is, I have the same opinion
of his understanding, but I think with
you, he has more tenderness and real
delicacy of feeling with respect to women,
than are commonly to be met with.
His manner too of speaking of his little
girl, about the age of mine, interested
me. I gave him a letter for my sister,
and requested him to see her.</p>

<p>I have been interrupted. Mr. &mdash;&mdash;
I suppose will write about business.<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-64" id="CPg_3-64"></a>[<a href="images/v3-64.png">64</a>]</span>
Public affairs I do not descant on, except
to tell you that they write now
with great freedom and truth, and this
liberty of the press will overthrow the
Jacobins, I plainly perceive.</p>

<p>I hope you take care of your health.
I have got a habit of restlessness at
night, which arises, I believe, from
activity of mind; for, when I am alone,
that is, not near one to whom I can
open my heart, I sink into reveries and
trains of thinking, which agitate and
fatigue me.</p>

<p>This is my third letter; when am I
to hear from you? I need not tell you,
I suppose, that I am now writing with
somebody in the room with me, and
&mdash;&mdash; is waiting to carry this to Mr.
&mdash;&mdash;'s. I will then kiss the girl for
you, and bid you adieu.</p>

<p>I desired you, in one of my other<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-65" id="CPg_3-65"></a>[<a href="images/v3-65.png">65</a>]</span>
letters, to bring back to me your barrier-face&mdash;or
that you should not be
loved by my barrier-girl. I know that
you will love her more and more, for
she is a little affectionate, intelligent
creature, with as much vivacity, I
should think, as you could wish for.</p>

<p>I was going to tell you of two or
three things which displease me here;
but they are not of sufficient consequence
to interrupt pleasing sensations.
I have received a letter from
Mr. &mdash;&mdash;. I want you to bring &mdash;&mdash;
with you. Madame S&mdash;&mdash; is by me,
reading a German translation of your
letters&mdash;she desires me to give her love
to you, on account of what you say of
the negroes.</p>

<h4>LETTER XXV</h4>

<p class="right">Paris, Sept. 28.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> written to you three or four
letters; but different causes have prevented
my sending them by the persons
who promised to take or forward them.
The inclosed is one I wrote to go by
B&mdash;&mdash;; yet, finding that he will not
arrive, before I hope, and believe, you
will have set out on your return, I
inclose it to you, and shall give it in
charge to &mdash;&mdash;, as Mr. &mdash;&mdash; is detained,
to whom I also gave a letter.</p>

<p>I cannot help being anxious to hear
from you; but I shall not harrass you
with accounts of inquietudes, or of
cares that arise from peculiar circumstances.&mdash;I
have had so many little<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-67" id="CPg_3-67"></a>[<a href="images/v3-67.png">67</a>]</span>
plagues here, that I have almost lamented
that I left H&mdash;&mdash;. &mdash;&mdash;, who
is at best a most helpless creature, is
now, on account of her pregnancy,
more trouble than use to me, so that I
still continue to be almost a slave to the
child.&mdash;She indeed rewards me, for
she is a sweet little creature; for, setting
aside a mother's fondness (which,
by the bye, is growing on me, her little
intelligent smiles sinking into my heart),
she has an astonishing degree of sensibility
and observation. The other day
by B&mdash;&mdash;'s child, a fine one, she looked
like a little sprite.&mdash;She is all life and
motion, and her eyes are not the eyes
of a fool&mdash;I will swear.</p>

room (if you have not forgot) in which
you pressed me very tenderly to your
heart.&mdash;I did not forget to fold my<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-68" id="CPg_3-68"></a>[<a href="images/v3-68.png">68</a>]</span>
darling to mine, with sensations that
are almost too sacred to be alluded to.</p>

<p>Adieu, my love! Take care of yourself,
if you wish to be the protector of
your child, and the comfort of her
mother.</p>

<p>I have received, for you, letters from
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. I want to hear how that
affair finishes, though I do not know
whether I have most contempt for his
folly or knavery.</p>

<h4>LETTER XXVI</h4>

<p class="right">October 1.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a heartless task to write letters,
without knowing whether they will
ever reach you.&mdash;I have given two to
&mdash;&mdash;, who has been a-going, a-going,
every day, for a week past; and three
others, which were written in a low-spirited
strain, a little querulous or so,
I have not been able to forward by the
opportunities that were mentioned to
me. <i>Tant mieux!</i> you will say, and I
will not say nay; for I should be sorry
that the contents of a letter, when you
are so far away, should damp the pleasure
that the sight of it would afford&mdash;judging
of your feelings by my own.<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-70" id="CPg_3-70"></a>[<a href="images/v3-70.png">70</a>]</span>
I just now stumbled on one of the kind
letters, which you wrote during your
last absence. You are then a dear
affectionate creature, and I will not
plague you. The letter which you
chance to receive, when the absence is
so long, ought to bring only tears of
tenderness, without any bitter alloy,
into your eyes.</p>

<p>After your return I hope indeed,
that you will not be so immersed in
business, as during the last three or
four months past&mdash;for even money, taking
into the account all the future comforts
it is to procure, may be gained at
too dear a rate, if painful impressions
are left on the mind.&mdash;These impressions
were much more lively, soon after
you went away, than at present&mdash;for a
thousand tender recollections efface the
melancholy traces they left on my mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-71" id="CPg_3-71"></a>[<a href="images/v3-71.png">71</a>]</span>&mdash;and
every emotion is on the same side
as my reason, which always was on
yours.&mdash;Separated, it would be almost
impious to dwell on real or imaginary
imperfections of character.&mdash;I feel that
I love you; and, if I cannot be happy
with you, I will seek it no where else.</p>

<p>My little darling grows every day
more dear to me&mdash;and she often has a
kiss, when we are alone together,
which I give her for you, with all my
heart.</p>

<p>I have been interrupted&mdash;and must
send off my letter. The liberty of the
press will produce a great effect here&mdash;the
<i>cry of blood will not be vain</i>!&mdash;Some
more monsters will perish&mdash;and the
Jacobins are conquered.&mdash;Yet I almost
fear the last slap of the tail of the
beast.</p>

<p>I have had several trifling teazing<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-72" id="CPg_3-72"></a>[<a href="images/v3-72.png">72</a>]</span>
inconveniencies here, which I shall not
now trouble you with a detail of.&mdash;I
am sending &mdash;&mdash; back; her pregnancy
rendered her useless. The girl I have
got has more vivacity, which is better
for the child.</p>

<p>I long to hear from you.&mdash;Bring a
copy of &mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash; with you.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; is still here: he is a lost man.&mdash;He
really loves his wife, and is anxious
about his children; but his indiscriminate
hospitality and social feelings have
given him an inveterate habit of drinking,
that destroys his health, as well as
renders his person disgusting.&mdash;If his
wife had more sense, or delicacy, she
might restrain him: as it is, nothing
will save him.</p>

<p class="right">October 26.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> dear love, I began to wish so earnestly
to hear from you, that the sight
of your letters occasioned such pleasurable
emotions, I was obliged to throw
them aside till the little girl and I were
alone together; and this said little girl,
our darling, is become a most intelligent
little creature, and as gay as a lark,
and that in the morning too, which I
do not find quite so convenient. I
once told you, that the sensations before
she was born, and when she is
sucking, were pleasant; but they do
not deserve to be compared to the emotions
I feel, when she stops to smile<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-74" id="CPg_3-74"></a>[<a href="images/v3-74.png">74</a>]</span>
upon me, or laughs outright on meeting
me unexpectedly in the street, or
after a short absence. She has now the
advantage of having two good nurses,
and I am at present able to discharge
my duty to her, without being the
slave of it.</p>

<p>I have therefore employed and amused
myself since I got rid of &mdash;&mdash;, and am
making a progress in the language
amongst other things. I have also made
some new acquaintance. I have almost

who, though I should not have thought
it possible, has humanity, if not <i>beaucoup

too broad-faced or so, and plays sweetly

a sprightly vein, when writing to you,
that is, when I am pleased with you.

said to be "in a good humour, when
he is pleased." Will you not then be

child; and I am sorry that you are not
here, to see her little mind unfold itself.
You talk of "dalliance;" but certainly
no lover was ever more attached to his
mistress, than she is to me. Her eyes
follow me every where, and by affection
I have the most despotic power
over her. She is all vivacity or softness&mdash;yes;
I love her more than I
thought I should. When I have been
hurt at your stay, I have embraced her
as my only comfort&mdash;when pleased with
you, for looking and laughing like

knowing that you
are well, and think of me with affec<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-80" id="CPg_3-80"></a>[<a href="images/v3-80.png">80</a>]</span>tion,
I only lament other disappointments,
because I am sorry that you
should thus exert yourself in vain, and
that you are kept from me.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, I know, urges you to stay,
and is continually branching out into
new projects, because he has the idle
desire to amass a large fortune, rather
an immense one, merely to have the
credit of having made it. But we
who are governed by other motives,
ought not to be led on by him. When
we meet, we will discuss this subject&mdash;You
will listen to reason, and it has
probably occurred to you, that it will
be better, in future, to pursue some
sober plan, which may demand more
time, and still enable you to arrive at
the same end. It appears to me absurd
to waste life in preparing to live.</p>

<p>Would it not now be possible to ar<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-81" id="CPg_3-81"></a>[<a href="images/v3-81.png">81</a>]</span>range
your business in such a manner
as to avoid the inquietudes, of which
I have had my share since your departure?
Is it not possible to enter into
business, as an employment necessary
to keep the faculties awake, and (to
sink a little in the expressions) the pot
boiling, without suffering what must
ever be considered as a secondary object,
to engross the mind, and drive
sentiment and affection out of the
heart?</p>

<p>I am in a hurry to give this letter to
the person who has promised to forward
it with &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s. I wish then to
counteract, in some measure, what
<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'he he'">he</ins> has doubtless recommended most
warmly.</p>

<p>Stay, my friend, whilst it is <i>absolutely</i>
necessary.&mdash;I will give you no tenderer
name, though it glows at my heart,<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-82" id="CPg_3-82"></a>[<a href="images/v3-82.png">82</a>]</span>
unless you come the moment the settling
the <i>present</i> objects permit.&mdash;<i>I do not
consent</i> to your taking any other journey&mdash;or
the little woman and I will be
off, the Lord knows where. But, as I
had rather owe every thing to your affection,
and, I may add, to your reason,
(for this immoderate desire of
wealth, which makes &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; so eager
to have you remain, is contrary to your
principles of action), I will not importune
you.&mdash;I will only tell you, that I
long to see you&mdash;and, being at peace
with you, I shall be hurt, rather than
made angry, by delays.&mdash;Having suffered
so much in life, do not be surprised
if I sometimes, when left to
myself, grow gloomy, and suppose that
it was all a dream, and that my happiness
is not to last. I say happiness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-83" id="CPg_3-83"></a>[<a href="images/v3-83.png">83</a>]</span>
because remembrance retrenches all
the dark shades of the picture.</p>

<p>My little one begins to show her
teeth, and use her legs&mdash;She wants you
to bear your part in the nursing business,
for I am fatigued with dancing
her, and yet she is not satisfied&mdash;she
wants you to thank her mother for taking
such care of her, as you only can.</p>

<p>How I hate this crooked business!
This intercourse with the world, which
obliges one to see the worst side of
human nature! Why cannot you be
content with the object you had first in
view, when you entered into this wearisome
labyrinth?&mdash;I know very well
that you have imperceptibly been
drawn on; yet why does one project,
successful or abortive, only give place
to two others? Is it not sufficient to
avoid poverty?&mdash;I am contented to do
my part; and, even here, sufficient to
escape from wretchedness is not difficult
to obtain. And, let me tell you,
I have my project also&mdash;and, if you do
not soon return, the little girl and I
will take care of ourselves; we will not<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-85" id="CPg_3-85"></a>[<a href="images/v3-85.png">85</a>]</span>
accept any of your cold kindness&mdash;your
distant civilities&mdash;no; not we.</p>

<p>This is but half jesting, for I am
really tormented by the desire which
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; manifests to have you remain
where you are.&mdash;Yet why do I talk to
you?&mdash;If he can persuade you&mdash;let him!&mdash;for,
if you are not happier with me,
and your own wishes do not make you
throw aside these eternal projects, I am
above using any arguments, though
reason as well as affection seems to offer
them&mdash;if our affection be mutual,
they will occur to you&mdash;and you will
act accordingly.</p>

<p>Since my arrival here, I have found
the German lady, of whom you have
heard me speak. Her first child died
in the month; but she has another,
about the age of my &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, a fine
little creature. They are still but con<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-86" id="CPg_3-86"></a>[<a href="images/v3-86.png">86</a>]</span>triving
to live&mdash;&mdash;earning their daily
bread&mdash;yet, though they are but just
above poverty, I envy them.&mdash;She is a
tender, affectionate mother&mdash;fatigued
even by her attention.&mdash;However she
has an affectionate husband in her turn,
to render her care light, and to share
her pleasure.</p>

<p>I will own to you that, feeling extreme
tenderness for my little girl, I
grow sad very often when I am playing
with her, that you are not here, to
observe with me how her mind unfolds,
and her little heart becomes attached!&mdash;These
appear to me to be true pleasures&mdash;and
still you suffer them to escape
you, in search of what we may
never enjoy.&mdash;It is your own maxim to
"live in the present moment."&mdash;<i>If you
do</i>&mdash;stay, for God's sake; but tell me
the truth&mdash;if not, tell me when I may<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-87" id="CPg_3-87"></a>[<a href="images/v3-87.png">87</a>]</span>
expect to see you, and let me not be
always vainly looking for you, till I
grow sick at heart.</p>

<p>Adieu! I am a little hurt.&mdash;I must
take my darling to my bosom to comfort
me.</p>

<p class="right">December 30.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Should</span> you receive three or four of
the letters at once which I have written
lately, do not think of Sir John
Brute, for I do not mean to wife you.
I only take advantage of every occasion,
that one out of three of my
epistles may reach your hands, and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-88" id="CPg_3-88"></a>[<a href="images/v3-88.png">88</a>]</span>form
you that I am not of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s
opinion, who talks till he makes me
angry, of the necessity of your staying
two or three months longer. I do not
like this life of continual inquietude&mdash;and,
<i>entre nous</i>, I am determined to try
to earn some money here myself, in
order to convince you that, if you
chuse to run about the world to get a
fortune, it is for yourself&mdash;for the little
girl and I will live without your assistance,
unless you are with us. I may
be termed proud&mdash;Be it so&mdash;but I will
never abandon certain principles of
action.</p>

<p>The common run of men have such
an ignoble way of thinking, that, if
they debauch their hearts, and prostitute
their persons, following perhaps a
gust of inebriation, they suppose the
wife, slave rather, whom they main<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-89" id="CPg_3-89"></a>[<a href="images/v3-89.png">89</a>]</span>tain,
has no right to complain, and
ought to receive the sultan, whenever
he deigns to return, with open arms,
though his have been polluted by half
an hundred promiscuous amours during
his absence.</p>

<p>I consider fidelity and constancy as
two distinct things; yet the former is
necessary, to give life to the other&mdash;and
such a degree of respect do I think
due to myself, that, if only probity,
which is a good thing in its place,
brings you back, never return!&mdash;for,
if a wandering of the heart, or even a
caprice of the imagination detains
you&mdash;there is an end of all my hopes of
happiness&mdash;I could not forgive it, if I
would.</p>

<p>I have gotten into a melancholy
mood, you perceive. You know my
opinion of men in general; you know<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-90" id="CPg_3-90"></a>[<a href="images/v3-90.png">90</a>]</span>
that I think them systematic tyrants, and
that it is the rarest thing in the world,
to meet with a man with sufficient
delicacy of feeling to govern desire.
When I am thus sad, I lament that my
little darling, fondly as I doat on her,
is a girl.&mdash;I am sorry to have a tie to a
world that for me is ever sown with
thorns.</p>

<p>You will call this an ill-humoured
letter, when, in fact, it is the strongest
proof of affection I can give, to dread
to lose you. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; has taken such
pains to convince me that you must
and ought to stay, that it has inconceivably
depressed my spirits&mdash;You
have always known my opinion&mdash;I have
ever declared, that two people, who
mean to live together, ought not to be
long separated.&mdash;If certain things are
more necessary to you than me&mdash;search<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-91" id="CPg_3-91"></a>[<a href="images/v3-91.png">91</a>]</span>

shall never hear of me more.&mdash;If not&mdash;for
God's sake, let us struggle with
poverty&mdash;with any evil, but these continual
inquietudes of business, which
I have been told were to last but a few
months, though every day the end appears
more distant! This is the first
letter in this strain that I have determined
to forward to you; the rest lie
by, because I was unwilling to give you
pain, and I should not now write, if I
did not think that there would be no
conclusion to the schemes, which demand,
as I am told, your presence.</p>

<h4>LETTER XXXII</h4>

<p class="right">January 9.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I just</span> now received one of your
hasty <i>notes</i>; for business so entirely occupies
you, that you have not time, or
sufficient command of thought, to write
letters. Beware! you seem to be got
into a whirl of projects and schemes,
which are drawing you into a gulph,
that, if it do not absorb your happiness,
will infallibly destroy mine.</p>

<p>Fatigued during my youth by the
most arduous struggles, not only to obtain
independence, but to render myself
useful, not merely pleasure, for
which I had the most lively taste, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-93" id="CPg_3-93"></a>[<a href="images/v3-93.png">93</a>]</span>
mean the simple pleasures that flow from
passion and affection, escaped me, but
the most melancholy views of life were
impressed by a disappointed heart on
my mind. Since I knew you, I have
been endeavouring to go back to my
former nature, and have allowed some
time to glide away, winged with the
delight which only spontaneous enjoyment
can give.&mdash;Why have you so
soon dissolved the charm?</p>

<p>I am really unable to bear the continual
inquietude which your and
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s never-ending plans produce.
This you may term want of firmness&mdash;but
you are mistaken&mdash;I have still sufficient
firmness to pursue my principle
of action. The present misery, I cannot
find a softer word to do justice to
my feelings, appears to me unneces<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-94" id="CPg_3-94"></a>[<a href="images/v3-94.png">94</a>]</span>sary&mdash;and
therefore I have not firmness
to support it as you may think I
ought. I should have been content,
and still wish, to retire with you to a
farm&mdash;My God! any thing, but these
continual anxieties&mdash;any thing but
commerce, which debases the mind,
and roots out affection from the heart.</p>

<p>I do not mean to complain of subordinate
inconveniences&mdash;&mdash;yet I will
simply observe, that, led to expect
you every week, I did not make the
arrangements required by the present
circumstances, to procure the necessaries
of life. In order to have them,
a servant, for that purpose only, is indispensible&mdash;The
want of wood, has made
me catch the most violent cold I ever
had; and my head is so disturbed by
continual coughing, that I am unable<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-95" id="CPg_3-95"></a>[<a href="images/v3-95.png">95</a>]</span>
to write without stopping frequently to
recollect myself.&mdash;This however is one
of the common evils which must be
borne with&mdash;&mdash;bodily pain does not
touch the heart, though it fatigues the
spirits.</p>

<p>Still as you talk of your return, even
in February, doubtingly, I have determined,
the moment the weather
changes, to wean my child.&mdash;It is too
soon for her to begin to divide sorrow!&mdash;And
as one has well said, "despair is a
freeman," we will go and seek our fortune
together.</p>

<p>This is not a caprice of the moment&mdash;for
your absence has given new
weight to some conclusions, that I was
very reluctantly forming before you
left me.&mdash;I do not chuse to be a secondary
object.&mdash;If your feelings were
in unison with mine, you would not<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-96" id="CPg_3-96"></a>[<a href="images/v3-96.png">96</a>]</span>

with the fag end of a song, which would
only have told you, what I may as well
say simply, that it is pleasant to forgive
those we love. I have received your
two letters, dated the 26th and 28th
of December, and my anger died away.
You can scarcely conceive the effect
some of your letters have produced on
me. After longing to hear from you
during a tedious interval of suspense,
I have seen a superscription written by<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-97" id="CPg_3-97"></a>[<a href="images/v3-97.png">97</a>]</span>

the cutting of her teeth; and now
she has two, she makes good use of
them to gnaw a crust, biscuit, &amp;c. You
would laugh to see her; she is just like
a little squirrel; she will guard a crust

some time hung on my spirits, that we
were parted for ever; and the letters I
received this day, by Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, convince
me that it was not without foundation.
You allude to some other
letters, which I suppose have miscarried;
for most of those I have got, were
only a few hasty lines, calculated to
wound the tenderness the sight of the
superscriptions excited.</p>

<p>I mean not however to complain;
yet so many feelings are struggling for
utterance, and agitating a heart almost
bursting with anguish, that I find it<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-102" id="CPg_3-102"></a>[<a href="images/v3-102.png">102</a>]</span>

<p>You left me indisposed, though you
have taken no notice of it; and the
most fatiguing journey I ever had, contributed
to continue it. However, I
recovered my health; but a neglected
cold, and continual inquietude during
the last two months, have reduced me
to a state of weakness I never before
experienced. Those who did not know
that the canker-worm was at work at
the core, cautioned me about suckling
my child too long.&mdash;God preserve this
poor child, and render her happier
than her mother!</p>

<p>But I am wandering from my subject:
indeed my head turns giddy, when I
think that all the confidence I have had
in the affection of others is come to this.</p>

I have done my duty to you and my
child; and if I am not to have any
return of affection to reward me, I
have the sad consolation of knowing
that I deserved a better fate. My
soul is weary&mdash;I am sick at heart; and,
but for this little darling, I would
cease to care about a life, which is now
stripped of every charm.</p>

<p>You see how stupid I am, uttering
declamation, when I meant simply to
tell you, that I consider your requesting
me to come to you, as merely dictated
by honour.&mdash;Indeed, I scarcely understand
you.&mdash;You request me to come,
and then tell me, that you have not
given up all thoughts of returning to
this place.</p>

<p>When I determined to live with you,
I was only governed by affection.&mdash;I
would share poverty with you, but I<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-104" id="CPg_3-104"></a>[<a href="images/v3-104.png">104</a>]</span>
turn with affright from the sea of trouble
on which you are entering.&mdash;I have
certain principles of action: I know
what I look for to found my happiness
on.&mdash;It is not money.&mdash;With you I
wished for sufficient to procure the
comforts of life&mdash;as it is, less will
do.&mdash;I can still exert myself to
obtain the necessaries of life for my
child, and she does not want more at
present.&mdash;I have two or three plans in
my head to earn our subsistence; for
do not suppose that, neglected by you,
I will lie under obligations of a pecuniary
kind to you!&mdash;No; I would sooner
submit to menial service.&mdash;I wanted the
support of your affection&mdash;that gone,
all is over!&mdash;I did not think, when I
complained of &mdash;&mdash;'s contemptible avidity
to accumulate money, that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-105" id="CPg_3-105"></a>[<a href="images/v3-105.png">105</a>]</span>
would have dragged you into his
schemes.</p>

<p>I cannot write.&mdash;I inclose a fragment
of a letter, written soon after your
departure, and another which tenderness
made me keep back when it was
written.&mdash;You will see then the sentiments
of a calmer, though not a more
determined, moment.&mdash;Do not insult
me by saying, that "our being together
is paramount to every other consideration!"
Were it, you would not be
running after a bubble, at the expence
of my peace of mind.</p>

mention! She has a child of the same
age, and they may be brought up to<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-107" id="CPg_3-107"></a>[<a href="images/v3-107.png">107</a>]</span>gether,
as I wish her to be brought up.
I shall write more fully on the subject.
To facilitate this, I shall give up my
present lodgings, and go into the same
house. I can live much cheaper there,
which is now become an object. I have
had 3000 livres from &mdash;&mdash;, and I shall
take one more, to pay my servant's
wages, &amp;c. and then I shall endeavour
to procure what I want by my own exertions.
I shall entirely give up the acquaintance
of the Americans.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; and I have not been on good
terms a long time. Yesterday he very
unmanlily exulted over me, on account
of your determination to stay. I had
provoked it, it is true, by some asperities
against commerce, which have
dropped from me, when we have argued
about the propriety of your remaining
where you are; and it is no matter, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-108" id="CPg_3-108"></a>[<a href="images/v3-108.png">108</a>]</span>
have drunk too deep of the bitter cup
to care about trifles.</p>

<p>When you first entered into these
plans, you bounded your views to the
gaining of a thousand pounds. It was
sufficient to have procured a farm in
America, which would have been an
independence. You find now that you
did not know yourself, and that a certain
situation in life is more necessary
to you than you imagined&mdash;more necessary
than an uncorrupted heart&mdash;For
a year or two, you may procure yourself
what you call pleasure; eating,
drinking, and women; but, in the solitude
of declining life, I shall be remembered
with regret&mdash;I was going to
say with remorse, but checked my
pen.</p>

<p>As I have never concealed the nature of
my connection with you, your repu<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-109" id="CPg_3-109"></a>[<a href="images/v3-109.png">109</a>]</span>tation
will not suffer. I shall never have
a confident: I am content with the approbation
of my own mind; and, if there
be a searcher of hearts, mine will not
be despised. Reading what you have
written relative to the desertion of women,
I have often wondered how theory
and practice could be so different, till
I recollected, that the sentiments of
passion, and the resolves of reason, are
very distinct. As to my sisters, as you
are so continually hurried with business,
you need not write to them&mdash;I
shall, when my mind is calmer. God
bless you! Adieu!</p>

<p class="right">* * * *</p>

<p>This has been such a period of barbarity
and misery, I ought not to complain
of having my share. I wish one
moment that I had never heard of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-110" id="CPg_3-110"></a>[<a href="images/v3-110.png">110</a>]</span>
cruelties that have been practised here,
and the next envy the mothers who
have been killed with their children.
Surely I had suffered enough in life,
not to be cursed with a fondness, that
burns up the vital stream I am imparting.
You will think me mad: I
would I were so, that I could forget
my misery&mdash;so that my head or heart
would be still.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h4>LETTER XXXVII</h4>

<p class="right">Feb. 19.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I first received your letter,
putting off your return to an indefinite
time, I felt so hurt, that I know not
what I wrote. I am now calmer,
though it was not the kind of wound<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-111" id="CPg_3-111"></a>[<a href="images/v3-111.png">111</a>]</span>
over which time has the quickest effect;
on the contrary, the more I think, the
sadder I grow. Society fatigues me inexpressibly&mdash;So
much so, that finding
fault with every one, I have only reason
enough, to discover that the fault is
in myself. My child alone interests
me, and, but for her, I should not take
any pains to recover my health.</p>

<p>As it is, I shall wean her, and try if
by that step (to which I feel a repugnance,
for it is my only solace) I can
get rid of my cough. Physicians talk
much of the danger attending any complaint
on the lungs, after a woman has
suckled for some months. They lay a
stress also on the necessity of keeping
the mind tranquil&mdash;and, my God! how
has mine been harrassed! But whilst
the caprices of other women are gratified,
"the wind of heaven not suffered<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-112" id="CPg_3-112"></a>[<a href="images/v3-112.png">112</a>]</span>
to visit them too rudely," I have not
found a guardian angel, in heaven or
on earth, to ward off sorrow or care
from my bosom.</p>

<p>What sacrifices have you not made
for a woman you did not respect!&mdash;But
I will not go over this ground&mdash;I want
to tell you that I do not understand
you. You say that you have not given
up all thoughts of returning here&mdash;and
I know that it will be necessary&mdash;nay,
is. I cannot explain myself; but if you
have not lost your memory, you will
easily divine my meaning. What! is
our life then only to be made up of separations?
and am I only to return to
a country, that has not merely lost all
charms for me, but for which I feel a
repugnance that almost amounts to
horror, only to be left there a prey to
it!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-113" id="CPg_3-113"></a>[<a href="images/v3-113.png">113</a>]</span>
Why is it so necessary that I should
return?&mdash;brought up here, my girl
would be freer. Indeed, expecting you
to join us, I had formed some plans
of usefulness that have now vanished
with my hopes of happiness.</p>

<p>In the bitterness of my heart, I could
complain with reason, that I am left
here dependent on a man, whose avidity
to acquire a fortune has rendered
him callous to every sentiment connected
with social or affectionate emotions.&mdash;With
a brutal insensibility, he
cannot help displaying the pleasure
your determination to stay gives him,
in spite of the effect it is visible it has
had on me.</p>

<p>Till I can earn money, I shall endeavour
to borrow some, for I want to
avoid asking him continually for the
sum necessary to maintain me.&mdash;Do not<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-114" id="CPg_3-114"></a>[<a href="images/v3-114.png">114</a>]</span>
mistake me, I have never been refused.&mdash;Yet
I have gone half a dozen times
to the house to ask for it, and come
away without speaking&mdash;&mdash;you must
guess why&mdash;Besides, I wish to avoid
hearing of the eternal projects to which
you have sacrificed my peace&mdash;not remembering&mdash;but
I will be silent for
ever.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

letter, and am distressed to think that I
have added to your embarrassments at
this troublesome juncture, when the
exertion of all the faculties of your mind
appears to be necessary, to extricate
you out of your pecuniary difficulties.
I suppose it was something relative to
the circumstance you have mentioned,

to-day, to <i>converse about a matter of great

is a feeling so different from the resignation

<h4>LETTER XLIV</h4>

<p class="right">Friday, June 12.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> just received yours dated the
9th, which I suppose was a mistake, for
it could scarcely have loitered so long
on the road. The general observations
which apply to the state of your own
mind, appear to me just, as far as they
go; and I shall always consider it as
one of the most serious misfortunes of
my life, that I did not meet you, before
satiety had rendered your senses so fastidious,
as almost to close up every tender
avenue of sentiment and affection
that leads to your sympathetic heart.
You have a heart, my friend, yet, hurried
away by the impetuosity of inferior
feelings, you have sought in vulgar<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-128" id="CPg_3-128"></a>[<a href="images/v3-128.png">128</a>]</span>
excesses, for that gratification which
only the heart can bestow.</p>

<p>The common run of men, I know,
with strong health and gross appetites,
must have variety to banish <i>ennui</i>, because
the imagination never lends its
magic wand, to convert appetite into
love, cemented by according reason.&mdash;Ah!
my friend, you know not the ineffable
delight, the exquisite pleasure,
which arises from a unison of affection
and desire, when the whole soul and
senses are abandoned to a lively imagination,
that renders every emotion delicate
and rapturous. Yes; these are
emotions, over which satiety has no
power, and the recollection of which,
even disappointment cannot disenchant;
but they do not exist without self-denial.
These emotions, more or less
strong, appear to me to be the distinc<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-129" id="CPg_3-129"></a>[<a href="images/v3-129.png">129</a>]</span>tive
characteristic of genius, the foundation
of taste, and of that exquisite
relish for the beauties of nature, of
which the common herd of eaters and
drinkers and <i>child-begeters</i>, certainly
have no idea. You will smile at an
observation that has just occurred to me:&mdash;I
consider those minds as the most
strong and original, whose imagination
acts as the stimulus to their senses.</p>

<p>Well! you will ask, what is the result
of all this reasoning? Why I cannot
help thinking that it is possible for
you, having great strength of mind,
to return to nature, and regain a sanity
of constitution, and purity of feeling&mdash;which
would open your heart to me.&mdash;I
would fain rest there!</p>

<p>Yet, convinced more than ever of
the sincerity and tenderness of my attachment
to you, the involuntary hopes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-130" id="CPg_3-130"></a>[<a href="images/v3-130.png">130</a>]</span>
which a determination to live has revived,
are not sufficiently strong to dissipate
the cloud, that despair has spread
over futurity. I have looked at the
sea, and at my child, hardly daring to
own to myself the secret wish, that it
might become our tomb; and that the
heart, still so alive to anguish, might
there be quieted by death. At this
moment ten thousand complicated sentiments
press for utterance, weigh on
my heart, and obscure my sight.</p>

<p>Are we ever to meet again? and will
you endeavour to render that meeting
happier than the last? Will you endeavour
to restrain your caprices, in order
to give vigour to affection, and to give
play to the checked sentiments that
nature intended should expand your
heart? I cannot indeed, without agony,
think of your bosom's being conti<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-131" id="CPg_3-131"></a>[<a href="images/v3-131.png">131</a>]</span>nually
contaminated; and bitter are
the tears which exhaust my eyes, when
I recollect why my child and I are
forced to stray from the asylum, in
which, after so many storms, I had
hoped to rest, smiling at angry fate.&mdash;These
are not common sorrows; nor
can you perhaps conceive, how much
active fortitude it requires to labour
perpetually to blunt the shafts of disappointment.</p>

<p>Examine now yourself, and ascertain
whether you can live in something-like
a settled stile. Let our confidence
in future be unbounded; consider whether
you find it necessary to sacrifice
me to what you term "the zest of life;"
and, when you have once a clear view
of your own motives, of your own incentive
to action, do not deceive me!</p>

<p>The train of thoughts which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-132" id="CPg_3-132"></a>[<a href="images/v3-132.png">132</a>]</span>
writing of this epistle awoke, makes
me so wretched, that I must take a
walk, to rouse and calm my mind.
But first, let me tell you, that, if you
really wish to promote my happiness,
you will endeavour to give me as much
as you can of yourself. You have great
mental energy; and your judgment
seems to me so just, that it is only the
dupe of your inclination in discussing
one subject.</p>

<p>The post does not go out to-day.
To-morrow I may write more tranquilly.
I cannot yet say when the vessel
will sail in which I have determined
to depart.</p>

my being conscious of it, some sparks

gloom of despair&mdash;Yes; with less affection,
I should have been more respectful.

have for you, is so unequivocal to myself,
I imagine that it must be sufficiently
obvious to every body else. Besides,

talks of sailing on Monday; but I am
afraid I shall be detained some days
longer. At any rate, continue to write,

I am where I cannot expect a letter;
and, if any should arrive after my departure,
a gentleman (not Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s
friend, I promise you) from whom I<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-135" id="CPg_3-135"></a>[<a href="images/v3-135.png">135</a>]</span>
have received great civilities, will send
them after me.</p>

<p>Do write by every occasion! I am
anxious to hear how your affairs go on;
and, still more, to be convinced that you
are not separating yourself from us.
For my little darling is calling papa,
and adding her parrot word&mdash;Come,
Come! And will you not come, and
let us exert ourselves?&mdash;I shall recover
all my energy, when I am convinced
that my exertions will draw us more
closely together. One more adieu!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I rather</span> expected to hear from you
to-day&mdash;I wish you would not fail to
write to me for a little time, because I
am not quite well&mdash;Whether I have any
good sleep or not, I wake in the morning
in violent fits of trembling&mdash;and,
in spite of all my efforts, the child&mdash;every
thing&mdash;fatigues me, in which I
seek for solace or amusement.</p>

<p>Mr. &mdash;&mdash; forced on me a letter to a
physician of this place; it was fortunate,
for I should otherwise have had some
difficulty to obtain the necessary information.
His wife is a pretty woman

hospitality; and poor &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; was never
so happy in her life, as amongst their
young brood.</p>

<p>They took me in their carriage to

walks, with a vivacity that would have
astonished you.&mdash;The town did not
please me quite so well as formerly&mdash;It
appeared so diminutive; and, when
I found that many of the inhabitants
had lived in the same houses ever since
I left it, I could not help wondering
how they could thus have vegetated,
whilst I was running over a world of
sorrow, snatching at pleasure, and
throwing off prejudices. The place
where I at present am, is much improved;
but it is astonishing what<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-138" id="CPg_3-138"></a>[<a href="images/v3-138.png">138</a>]</span>
strides aristocracy and fanaticism have
made, since I resided in this country.</p>

to change, so I am still forced to linger&mdash;When
do you think that you shall
be able to set out for France? I do
not entirely like the aspect of your affairs,
and still less your connections on
either side of the water. Often do I
sigh, when I think of your entanglements
in business, and your extreme
restlessness of mind.&mdash;Even now I am
almost afraid to ask you, whether the
pleasure of being free, does not over-balance
the pain you felt at parting
with me? Sometimes I indulge the
hope that you will feel me necessary to

my rising spirits, aggravated by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-139" id="CPg_3-139"></a>[<a href="images/v3-139.png">139</a>]</span>

taste) as renders them alive to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-162" id="CPg_3-162"></a>[<a href="images/v3-162.png">162</a>]</span>
beauties of nature, poetry, &amp;c., alive
to the charms of those evanescent graces
that are, as it were, impalpable&mdash;they
must be felt, they cannot be described.</p>

<p>Love is a want of my heart. I have
examined myself lately with more care
than formerly, and find, that to deaden
is not to calm the mind&mdash;Aiming at
tranquillity, I have almost destroyed all
the energy of my soul&mdash;almost rooted
out what renders it estimable&mdash;Yes, I
have damped that enthusiasm of character,
which converts the grossest
materials into a fuel, that imperceptibly
feeds hopes, which aspire above
common enjoyment. Despair, since
the birth of my child, has rendered me
stupid&mdash;soul and body seemed to be
fading away before the withering touch
of disappointment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-163" id="CPg_3-163"></a>[<a href="images/v3-163.png">163</a>]</span>
I am now endeavouring to recover
myself&mdash;and such is the elasticity of my
constitution, and the purity of the atmosphere
here, that health unsought
for, begins to reanimate my countenance.</p>

<p>I have the sincerest esteem and affection
for you&mdash;but the desire of regaining
peace, (do you understand me?)
has made me forget the respect due to
my own emotions&mdash;sacred emotions,
that are the sure harbingers of the delights
I was formed to enjoy&mdash;and
shall enjoy, for nothing can extinguish
the heavenly spark.</p>

<p>Still, when we meet again, I will
not torment you, I promise you. I
blush when I recollect my former conduct&mdash;and
will not in future confound
myself with the beings whom I feel to<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-164" id="CPg_3-164"></a>[<a href="images/v3-164.png">164</a>]</span>
be my inferiors.&mdash;I will listen to delicacy,
or pride.</p>

<h4>LETTER LVI</h4>

<p class="right">July 4.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I hope</span> to hear from you by to-morrow's
mail. My dearest friend! I cannot
tear my affections from you&mdash;and,
though every remembrance stings me
to the soul, I think of you, till I make
allowance for the very defects of character,
that have given such a cruel stab
to my peace.</p>

you have seen me for a long, long time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-165" id="CPg_3-165"></a>[<a href="images/v3-165.png">165</a>]</span>
I have a degree of vivacity, even in my
grief, which is preferable to the benumbing
stupour that, for the last year,
has frozen up all my faculties.&mdash;Perhaps
this change is more owing to returning
health, than to the vigour of
my reason&mdash;for, in spite of sadness (and
surely I have had my share), the purity
of this air, and the being continually
out in it, for I sleep in the country every
night, has made an alteration in my
appearance that really surprises me.&mdash;The
rosy fingers of health already streak
my cheeks&mdash;and I have seen a <i>physical</i>
life in my eyes, after I have been climbing
the rocks, that resembled the fond,
credulous hopes of youth.</p>

<p>With what a cruel sigh have I recollected
that I had forgotten to hope!&mdash;Reason,
or rather experience, does not
thus cruelly damp poor &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s plea<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-166" id="CPg_3-166"></a>[<a href="images/v3-166.png">166</a>]</span>sures;
she plays all day in the garden
with &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s children, and makes
friends for herself.</p>

<p>Do not tell me, that you are happier
without us&mdash;Will you not come to us in
Switzerland? Ah, why do not you
love us with more sentiment?&mdash;why
are you a creature of such sympathy,
that the warmth of your feelings, or
rather quickness of your senses, hardens
your heart? It is my misfortune,
that my imagination is perpetually
shading your defects, and lending you
charms, whilst the grossness of your
senses makes you (call me not vain)
overlook graces in me, that only dignity
of mind, and the sensibility of an
expanded heart can give.&mdash;God bless
you! Adieu.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> now on my journey to &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
I felt more at leaving my child, than I
thought I should&mdash;and, whilst at night
I imagined every instant that I heard
the half-formed sounds of her voice,&mdash;I
asked myself how I could think of
parting with her for ever, of leaving
her thus helpless?</p>

<p>Poor lamb! It may run very well
in a tale, that "God will temper the
winds to the shorn lamb!" but how

Yes; I could add, with poor Lear&mdash;What
is the war of elements to the
pangs of disappointed affection, and
the horror arising from a discovery of
a breach of confidence, that snaps every
social tie!</p>

<p>All is not right somewhere!&mdash;When
you first knew me, I was not thus lost.
I could still confide&mdash;for I opened my
heart to you&mdash;of this only comfort you
have deprived me, whilst my happiness,
you tell me, was your first object.
Strange want of judgment!</p>

<p>I will not complain; but, from the
soundness of your understanding, I am
convinced, if you give yourself leave to
reflect, you will also feel, that your
conduct to me, so far from being generous,
has not been just.&mdash;I mean not
to allude to factitious principles of
morality; but to the simple basis of all<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-171" id="CPg_3-171"></a>[<a href="images/v3-171.png">171</a>]</span>
rectitude.&mdash;However I did not intend

<p>Poor &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; would fain have accompanied
me, out of tenderness; for
my fainting, or rather convulsion,
when I landed, and my sudden changes
of countenance since, have alarmed
her so much, that she is perpetually
afraid of some accident&mdash;But it would
have injured the child this warm season,
as she is cutting her teeth.</p>

<p>I hear not of your having written to
me at &mdash;&mdash;. Very well! Act as you
please&mdash;there is nothing I fear or care
for! When I see whether I can, or

not a subject of complaint, it has afforded
me pleasure,&mdash;and reflected
pleasure is all I have to hope for&mdash;if a
spark of hope be yet alive in my forlorn
bosom.</p>

<p>I will try to write with a degree of
composure. I wish for us to live together,
because I want you to acquire an
habitual tenderness for my poor girl.
I cannot bear to think of leaving her
alone in the world, or that she should
only be protected by your sense of duty.
Next to preserving her, my most earnest
wish is not to disturb your peace. I
have nothing to expect, and little to
fear, in life&mdash;There are wounds that
can never be healed&mdash;but they may be
allowed to fester in silence without
wincing.</p>

than you give me credit for. I will not
torment you. If I am destined always
to be disappointed and unhappy, I will
conceal the anguish I cannot dissipate;
and the tightened cord of life or reason
will at last snap, and set me free.</p>

<p>Yes; I shall be happy&mdash;This heart is
worthy of the bliss its feelings anticipate&mdash;and
I cannot even persuade myself,
wretched as they have made me,
that my principles and sentiments are
not founded in nature and truth. But

you are right; our minds are

world, and fostered sentiments that you
do not comprehend&mdash;or you would not
treat me thus. I am not, I will not
be, merely an object of compassion&mdash;a
clog, however light, to teize you. Forget
that I exist: I will never remind
you. Something emphatical whispers
me to put an end to these struggles.
Be free&mdash;I will not torment, when I
cannot please. I can take care of my
child; you need not continually tell me
that our fortune is inseparable, <i>that you
will try to cherish tenderness</i> for me. Do
no violence to yourself! When we are
separated, our interest, since you give
so much weight to pecuniary considerations,
will be entirely divided. I want
not protection without affection; and
support I need not, whilst my faculties<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-186" id="CPg_3-186"></a>[<a href="images/v3-186.png">186</a>]</span>
are undisturbed. I had a dislike to living
in England; but painful feelings
must give way to superior considerations.
I may not be able to acquire
the sum necessary to maintain my child

I shall not force myself on you any

<p>I see here nothing but heaps of ruins,
and only converse with people immersed
in trade and sensuality.</p>

<p>I am weary of travelling&mdash;yet seem
to have no home&mdash;no resting place to
look to.&mdash;I am strangely cast off.&mdash;How
often, passing through the rocks, I have
thought, "But for this child, I would
lay my head on one of them, and never
open my eyes again!" With a heart
feelingly alive to all the affections of
my nature&mdash;I have never met with one,
softer than the stone that I would fain<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-189" id="CPg_3-189"></a>[<a href="images/v3-189.png">189</a>]</span>
take for my last pillow. I once thought
I had, but it was all a delusion. I meet
with families continually, who are
bound together by affection or principle&mdash;and,
when I am conscious that I
have fulfilled the duties of my station,
almost to a forgetfulness of myself, I
am ready to demand, in a murmuring
tone, of Heaven, "Why am I thus
abandoned?"</p>

<p>You say now&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;</p>

<p>I do not understand you. It is necessary
for you to write more explicitly&mdash;and
determine on some mode of conduct.&mdash;I
cannot endure this suspense&mdash;Decide&mdash;Do
you fear to strike another
blow? We live together, or eternally
part!&mdash;I shall not write to you again,
till I receive an answer to this. I must<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-190" id="CPg_3-190"></a>[<a href="images/v3-190.png">190</a>]</span>
compose my tortured soul, before I
write on indifferent subjects.&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&mdash;</p>

<p class="sp">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>
<p class="sp">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

<p>I do not know whether I write intelligibly,
for my head is disturbed.&mdash;But this
you ought to pardon&mdash;for it is with difficulty
frequently that I make out what
you mean to say&mdash;You write, I suppose,
at Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s after dinner, when your
head is not the clearest&mdash;and as for your
heart, if you have one, I see nothing
like the dictates of affection, unless a
glimpse when you mention, the child.&mdash;Adieu!</p>

<h4>LETTER LXVI</h4>

<p class="right">September 25.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> just finished a letter, to be
given in charge to captain &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
In that I complained of your silence,
and expressed my surprise that three
mails should have arrived without
bringing a line for me. Since I
closed it, I hear of another, and still
no letter.&mdash;I am labouring to write
calmly&mdash;this silence is a refinement on
cruelty. Had captain &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; remained
a few days longer, I would have
returned with him to England. What
have I to do here? I have repeatedly<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-192" id="CPg_3-192"></a>[<a href="images/v3-192.png">192</a>]</span>
written to you fully. Do you do the

in suspense. I have not deserved this
of you. I cannot write, my mind is
so distressed. Adieu!</p>

<h2><a name="CV3_PREFACE_S" id="CV3_PREFACE_S"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following Letters may po&#383;&#383;ibly
be found to contain the fine&#383;t examples
of the language of &#383;entiment and
pa&#383;&#383;ion ever pre&#383;ented to the world.
They bear a &#383;triking re&#383;emblance to
the celebrated romance of Werter,
though the incidents to which they relate
are of a very different ca&#383;t. Probably
the readers to whom Werter
is incapable of affording plea&#383;ure, will
receive no delight from the pre&#383;ent
publication. The editor apprehends<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-vii_S" id="CPg_3-vii_S"></a>[<a href="images/v3-vii.png">vii</a>]</span>
that, in the judgment of tho&#383;e be&#383;t
qualified to decide upon the compari&#383;on,
the&#383;e Letters will be admitted to
have the &#383;uperiority over the fiction of
Goethe. They are the off&#383;pring of a
glowing imagination, and a heart penetrated
with the pa&#383;&#383;ion it e&#383;&#383;ays to de&#383;cribe.</p>

<p>To the &#383;eries of letters con&#383;tituting
the principal article in the&#383;e two volumes,
are added various pieces, none
of which, it is hoped, will be found
di&#383;creditable to the talents of the author.
The &#383;light fragment of Letters on
the Management of Infants, may be
thought a trifle; but it &#383;eems to have
&#383;ome value, as pre&#383;enting to us with
vividne&#383;s the intention of the writer on<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-viii_S" id="CPg_3-viii_S"></a>[<a href="images/v3-viii.png">viii</a>]</span>
this important &#383;ubject. The publication
of a few &#383;elect Letters to Mr.
John&#383;on, appeared to be at once a ju&#383;t
monument to the &#383;incerity of his friend&#383;hip,
and a valuable and intere&#383;ting
&#383;pecimen of the mind of the writer.
The Letter on the Pre&#383;ent Character
of the French Nation, the Extract of
the Cave of Fancy, a Tale, and the
Hints for the Second Part of the Rights
of Woman, may, I believe, &#383;afely be
left to &#383;peak for them&#383;elves. The E&#383;&#383;ay
on Poetry and our Reli&#383;h for the Beauties
of Nature, appeared in the Monthly
Magazine for April la&#383;t, and is the
only piece in this collection which has
previou&#383;ly found its way to the pre&#383;s.</p>

I have &#383;ince &#383;een him, and he tells me
that he has &#383;ettled the bu&#383;ine&#383;s.</p>

<p>So much for bu&#383;ine&#383;s!&mdash;May I venture

have been following you all along the
road this comfortle&#383;s weather; for,
when I am ab&#383;ent from tho&#383;e I love, my

had never been gratified by their pre&#383;ence&mdash;I
was going to &#383;ay care&#383;&#383;es&mdash;and
why &#383;hould I not? I have found out
that I have more mind than you, in one
re&#383;pect; becau&#383;e I can, without any
violent effort of rea&#383;on, find food for
love in the &#383;ame object, much longer
than you can.&mdash;The way to my &#383;en&#383;es
is through my heart; but, forgive me!
I think there is &#383;ometimes a &#383;horter cut
to yours.</p>

<p>With ninety-nine men out of a hundred,
a very &#383;ufficient da&#383;h of folly is
nece&#383;&#383;ary to render a woman <i>piquante</i>, a
&#383;oft word for de&#383;irable; and, beyond
the&#383;e ca&#383;ual ebullitions of &#383;ympathy,
few look for enjoyment by fo&#383;tering a<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-9_S" id="CPg_3-9_S"></a>[<a href="images/v3-9.png">9</a>]</span>
pa&#383;&#383;ion in their hearts. One rea&#383;on, in
&#383;hort, why I wi&#383;h my whole &#383;ex to become
wi&#383;er, is, that the fooli&#383;h ones
may not, by their pretty folly, rob tho&#383;e
who&#383;e &#383;en&#383;ibility keeps down their vanity,
of the few ro&#383;es that afford them
&#383;ome &#383;olace in the thorny road of life.</p>

<p>I do not know how I fell into the&#383;e
reflections, excepting one thought produced
it&mdash;that the&#383;e continual &#383;eparations
were nece&#383;&#383;ary to warm your affection.&mdash;Of
late, we are always &#383;eparating.&mdash;Crack!&mdash;crack!&mdash;and away
you go.&mdash;This joke wears the &#383;allow
ca&#383;t of thought; for, though I began to
write cheerfully, &#383;ome melancholy tears
have found their way into my eyes, that
linger there, whil&#383;t a glow of tenderne&#383;s
at my heart whi&#383;pers that you are one
of the be&#383;t creatures in the world.&mdash;Pardon
then the vagaries of a mind,<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-10_S" id="CPg_3-10_S"></a>[<a href="images/v3-10.png">10</a>]</span>
that has been almo&#383;t "crazed by care,"
as well as "cro&#383;&#383;ed in haple&#383;s love,"
and bear with me a <i>little</i> longer!&mdash;When
we are &#383;ettled in the country together,
more duties will open before me, and
my heart, which now, trembling into
peace, is agitated by every emotion that
awakens the remembrance of old griefs,
will learn to re&#383;t on yours, with that
dignity your character, not to talk of
my own, demands.</p>

<p>Take care of your&#383;elf&mdash;and write
&#383;oon to your own girl (you may add
dear, if you plea&#383;e) who &#383;incerely loves
you, and will try to convince you of it,
by becoming happier.</p>

and my heart affectionate.</p>

<p>Ever &#383;ince you la&#383;t &#383;aw me inclined

which make me begin to think, that I
am nouri&#383;hing a creature who will &#383;oon
be &#383;en&#383;ible of my care.&mdash;This thought
has not only produced an overflowing of

comes again, and all the work is to be

when I am &#383;ad, I lament that all my

too &#383;trong for my peace, though they
all afford me &#383;natches of exqui&#383;ite enjoyment&mdash;This
for our little girl was at

of rea&#383;on, a &#383;en&#383;e of duty, than feeling&mdash;now,
&#383;he has got into my heart
and imagination, and when I walk out
without her, her little figure is ever
dancing before me.</p>

<p>You too have &#383;omehow clung round
my heart&mdash;I found I could not eat my<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-54_S" id="CPg_3-54_S"></a>[<a href="images/v3-54.png">54</a>]</span>

I took up the large knife to carve for
my&#383;elf, tears ru&#383;hed into my eyes.&mdash;Do
not however &#383;uppo&#383;e that I am melancholy&mdash;for,
when you are from me,
I not only wonder how I can find fault
with you&mdash;but how I can doubt your
affection.</p>

<p>I will not mix any comments on the
inclo&#383;ed (it rou&#383;ed my indignation)
with the effu&#383;ion of tenderne&#383;s, with
which I a&#383;&#383;ure you, that you are the

men together; but the imagination is
the true fire, &#383;tolen from heaven, to
animate this cold creature of clay, producing
all tho&#383;e fine &#383;ympathies that
lead to rapture, rendering men &#383;ocial

of his under&#383;tanding, but I think with

than are commonly to be met with.
His manner too of &#383;peaking of his little

&#383;o long, ought to bring only tears of
tenderne&#383;s, without any bitter alloy,
into your eyes.</p>

<p>After your return I hope indeed,
that you will not be &#383;o immer&#383;ed in
bu&#383;ine&#383;s, as during the la&#383;t three or
four months pa&#383;t&mdash;for even money, taking
into the account all the future comforts
it is to procure, may be gained at
too dear a rate, if painful impre&#383;&#383;ions
are left on the mind.&mdash;The&#383;e impre&#383;&#383;ions
were much more lively, &#383;oon after
you went away, than at pre&#383;ent&mdash;for a

every emotion is on the &#383;ame &#383;ide
as my rea&#383;on, which always was on
yours.&mdash;Separated, it would be almo&#383;t
impious to dwell on real or imaginary
imperfections of character.&mdash;I feel that
I love you; and, if I cannot be happy
with you, I will &#383;eek it no where el&#383;e.</p>

<p>My little darling grows every day
more dear to me&mdash;and &#383;he often has a
ki&#383;s, when we are alone together,
which I give her for you, with all my
heart.</p>

<p>I have been interrupted&mdash;and mu&#383;t
&#383;end off my letter. The liberty of the
pre&#383;s will produce a great effect here&mdash;the

about his children; but his indi&#383;criminate
ho&#383;pitality and &#383;ocial feelings have
given him an inveterate habit of drinking,
that de&#383;troys his health, as well as
renders his per&#383;on di&#383;gu&#383;ting.&mdash;If his
wife had more &#383;en&#383;e, or delicacy, &#383;he

&#383;uch a degree of re&#383;pect do I think
due to my&#383;elf, that, if only probity,
which is a good thing in its place,
brings you back, never return!&mdash;for,
if a wandering of the heart, or even a
caprice of the imagination detains
you&mdash;there is an end of all my hopes of
happine&#383;s&mdash;I could not forgive it, if I
would.</p>

<p>I have gotten into a melancholy
mood, you perceive. You know my
opinion of men in general; you know<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-90_S" id="CPg_3-90_S"></a>[<a href="images/v3-90.png">90</a>]</span>
that I think them &#383;y&#383;tematic tyrants, and
that it is the rare&#383;t thing in the world,
to meet with a man with &#383;ufficient
delicacy of feeling to govern de&#383;ire.
When I am thus &#383;ad, I lament that my
little darling, fondly as I doat on her,
is a girl.&mdash;I am &#383;orry to have a tie to a
world that for me is ever &#383;own with
thorns.</p>

<p>You will call this an ill-humoured

proof of affection I can give, to dread
to lo&#383;e you. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; has taken &#383;uch

mean to live together, ought not to be

&#383;hall never hear of me more.&mdash;If not&mdash;for
God's &#383;ake, let us &#383;truggle with
poverty&mdash;with any evil, but the&#383;e continual
inquietudes of bu&#383;ine&#383;s, which
I have been told were to la&#383;t but a few
months, though every day the end appears
more di&#383;tant! This is the fir&#383;t
letter in this &#383;train that I have determined
to forward to you; the re&#383;t lie
by, becau&#383;e I was unwilling to give you
pain, and I &#383;hould not now write, if I
did not think that there would be no
conclu&#383;ion to the &#383;chemes, which demand,
as I am told, your pre&#383;ence.</p>

<h4>LETTER XXXII</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">I ju&#383;t</span> now received one of your
ha&#383;ty <i>notes</i>; for bu&#383;ine&#383;s &#383;o entirely occupies

which are drawing you into a gulph,
that, if it do not ab&#383;orb your happine&#383;s,
will infallibly de&#383;troy mine.</p>

<p>Fatigued during my youth by the
mo&#383;t arduous &#383;truggles, not only to obtain
independence, but to render my&#383;elf
u&#383;eful, not merely plea&#383;ure, for
which I had the mo&#383;t lively ta&#383;te, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-93_S" id="CPg_3-93_S"></a>[<a href="images/v3-93.png">93</a>]</span>
mean the &#383;imple plea&#383;ures that flow from
pa&#383;&#383;ion and affection, e&#383;caped me, but
the mo&#383;t melancholy views of life were
impre&#383;&#383;ed by a di&#383;appointed heart on
my mind. Since I knew you, I have
been endeavouring to go back to my
former nature, and have allowed &#383;ome
time to glide away, winged with the
delight which only &#383;pontaneous enjoyment
can give.&mdash;Why have you &#383;o
&#383;oon di&#383;&#383;olved the charm?</p>

<p>I am really unable to bear the continual
inquietude which your and
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s never-ending plans produce.
This you may term want of firmne&#383;s&mdash;but
you are mi&#383;taken&mdash;I have &#383;till &#383;ufficient
firmne&#383;s to pur&#383;ue my principle
of action. The pre&#383;ent mi&#383;ery, I cannot
find a &#383;ofter word to do ju&#383;tice to
my feelings, appears to me unnece&#383;<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-94_S" id="CPg_3-94_S"></a>[<a href="images/v3-94.png">94</a>]</span>&#383;ary&mdash;and
therefore I have not firmne&#383;s
to &#383;upport it as you may think I
ought. I &#383;hould have been content,
and &#383;till wi&#383;h, to retire with you to a
farm&mdash;My God! any thing, but the&#383;e
continual anxieties&mdash;any thing but
commerce, which deba&#383;es the mind,
and roots out affection from the heart.</p>

<p>I do not mean to complain of &#383;ubordinate
inconveniences&mdash;&mdash;yet I will
&#383;imply ob&#383;erve, that, led to expect
you every week, I did not make the
arrangements required by the pre&#383;ent
circum&#383;tances, to procure the nece&#383;&#383;aries
of life. In order to have them,
a &#383;ervant, for that purpo&#383;e only, is indi&#383;pen&#383;ible&mdash;The
want of wood, has made
me catch the mo&#383;t violent cold I ever
had; and my head is &#383;o di&#383;turbed by
continual coughing, that I am unable<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-95_S" id="CPg_3-95_S"></a>[<a href="images/v3-95.png">95</a>]</span>
to write without &#383;topping frequently to
recollect my&#383;elf.&mdash;This however is one
of the common evils which mu&#383;t be
borne with&mdash;&mdash;bodily pain does not
touch the heart, though it fatigues the
&#383;pirits.</p>

<p>Still as you talk of your return, even
in February, doubtingly, I have determined,
the moment the weather
changes, to wean my child.&mdash;It is too
&#383;oon for her to begin to divide &#383;orrow!&mdash;And
as one has well &#383;aid, "de&#383;pair is a
freeman," we will go and &#383;eek our fortune
together.</p>

<p>This is not a caprice of the moment&mdash;for
your ab&#383;ence has given new
weight to &#383;ome conclu&#383;ions, that I was
very reluctantly forming before you
left me.&mdash;I do not chu&#383;e to be a &#383;econdary

<h4>LETTER XXXV</h4>

<p class="right">February 9.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> melancholy pre&#383;entiment has for
&#383;ome time hung on my &#383;pirits, that we
were parted for ever; and the letters I
received this day, by Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, convince
me that it was not without foundation.
You allude to &#383;ome other
letters, which I &#383;uppo&#383;e have mi&#383;carried;

very difficult to write with any degree
of coherence.</p>

<p>You left me indi&#383;po&#383;ed, though you
have taken no notice of it; and the
mo&#383;t fatiguing journey I ever had, contributed
to continue it. However, I
recovered my health; but a neglected
cold, and continual inquietude during

<p class="right">Feb. 10.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> talk of "permanent views and
future comfort"&mdash;not for me, for I am
dead to hope. The inquietudes of the
la&#383;t winter have fini&#383;hed the bu&#383;ine&#383;s,
and my heart is not only broken, but
my con&#383;titution de&#383;troyed. I conceive
my&#383;elf in a galloping con&#383;umption, and
the continual anxiety I feel at the
thought of leaving my child, feeds the
fever that nightly devours me. It is
on her account that I again write to
you, to conjure you, by all that you
hold &#383;acred, to leave her here with the
German lady you may have heard me

age, and they may be brought up to<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-107_S" id="CPg_3-107_S"></a>[<a href="images/v3-107.png">107</a>]</span>gether,
as I wi&#383;h her to be brought up.
I &#383;hall write more fully on the &#383;ubject.
To facilitate this, I &#383;hall give up my
pre&#383;ent lodgings, and go into the &#383;ame
hou&#383;e. I can live much cheaper there,
which is now become an object. I have
had 3000 livres from &mdash;&mdash;, and I &#383;hall
take one more, to pay my &#383;ervant's
wages, &amp;c. and then I &#383;hall endeavour
to procure what I want by my own exertions.
I &#383;hall entirely give up the acquaintance
of the Americans.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; and I have not been on good
terms a long time. Ye&#383;terday he very
unmanlily exulted over me, on account
of your determination to &#383;tay. I had
provoked it, it is true, by &#383;ome a&#383;perities
again&#383;t commerce, which have
dropped from me, when we have argued
about the propriety of your remaining
where you are; and it is no matter, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-108_S" id="CPg_3-108_S"></a>[<a href="images/v3-108.png">108</a>]</span>

to care about trifles.</p>

<p>When you fir&#383;t entered into the&#383;e
plans, you bounded your views to the
gaining of a thou&#383;and pounds. It was
&#383;ufficient to have procured a farm in
America, which would have been an
independence. You find now that you
did not know your&#383;elf, and that a certain
&#383;ituation in life is more nece&#383;&#383;ary
to you than you imagined&mdash;more nece&#383;&#383;ary

a year or two, you may procure your&#383;elf
what you call plea&#383;ure; eating,

with regret&mdash;I was going to

pen.</p>

<p>As I have never concealed the nature of
my connection with you, your repu<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-109_S" id="CPg_3-109_S"></a>[<a href="images/v3-109.png">109</a>]</span>tation

a confident: I am content with the approbation
of my own mind; and, if there
be a &#383;earcher of hearts, mine will not
be de&#383;pi&#383;ed. Reading what you have
written relative to the de&#383;ertion of women,
I have often wondered how theory
and practice could be &#383;o different, till
I recollected, that the &#383;entiments of
pa&#383;&#383;ion, and the re&#383;olves of rea&#383;on, are
very di&#383;tinct. As to my &#383;i&#383;ters, as you

<p>This has been &#383;uch a period of barbarity
and mi&#383;ery, I ought not to complain
of having my &#383;hare. I wi&#383;h one
moment that I had never heard of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-110_S" id="CPg_3-110_S"></a>[<a href="images/v3-110.png">110</a>]</span>
cruelties that have been practi&#383;ed here,
and the next envy the mothers who
have been killed with their children.
Surely I had &#383;uffered enough in life,
not to be cur&#383;ed with a fondne&#383;s, that
burns up the vital &#383;tream I am imparting.
You will think me mad: I
would I were &#383;o, that I could forget

<h4>LETTER XXXVII</h4>

<p class="right">Feb. 19.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I fir&#383;t received your letter,
putting off your return to an indefinite
time, I felt &#383;o hurt, that I know not
what I wrote. I am now calmer,
though it was not the kind of wound<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-111_S" id="CPg_3-111_S"></a>[<a href="images/v3-111.png">111</a>]</span>
over which time has the quicke&#383;t effect;
on the contrary, the more I think, the
&#383;adder I grow. Society fatigues me inexpre&#383;&#383;ibly&mdash;So
much &#383;o, that finding
fault with every one, I have only rea&#383;on
enough, to di&#383;cover that the fault is
in my&#383;elf. My child alone intere&#383;ts
me, and, but for her, I &#383;hould not take
any pains to recover my health.</p>

<p>As it is, I &#383;hall wean her, and try if
by that &#383;tep (to which I feel a repugnance,
for it is my only &#383;olace) I can
get rid of my cough. Phy&#383;icians talk
much of the danger attending any complaint
on the lungs, after a woman has
&#383;uckled for &#383;ome months. They lay a
&#383;tre&#383;s al&#383;o on the nece&#383;&#383;ity of keeping
the mind tranquil&mdash;and, my God! how
has mine been harra&#383;&#383;ed! But whil&#383;t
the caprices of other women are gratified,
"the wind of heaven not &#383;uffered<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-112_S" id="CPg_3-112_S"></a>[<a href="images/v3-112.png">112</a>]</span>
to vi&#383;it them too rudely," I have not
found a guardian angel, in heaven or
on earth, to ward off &#383;orrow or care
from my bo&#383;om.</p>

<p>What &#383;acrifices have you not made
for a woman you did not re&#383;pect!&mdash;But
I will not go over this ground&mdash;I want
to tell you that I do not under&#383;tand
you. You &#383;ay that you have not given
up all thoughts of returning here&mdash;and
I know that it will be nece&#383;&#383;ary&mdash;nay,
is. I cannot explain my&#383;elf; but if you
have not lo&#383;t your memory, you will
ea&#383;ily divine my meaning. What! is
our life then only to be made up of &#383;eparations?
and am I only to return to
a country, that has not merely lo&#383;t all
charms for me, but for which I feel a
repugnance that almo&#383;t amounts to
horror, only to be left there a prey to
it!</p>

Why is it &#383;o nece&#383;&#383;ary that I &#383;hould
return?&mdash;brought up here, my girl
would be freer. Indeed, expecting you
to join us, I had formed &#383;ome plans
of u&#383;efulne&#383;s that have now vani&#383;hed
with my hopes of happine&#383;s.</p>

<p>In the bitterne&#383;s of my heart, I could
complain with rea&#383;on, that I am left
here dependent on a man, who&#383;e avidity
to acquire a fortune has rendered
him callous to every &#383;entiment connected
with &#383;ocial or affectionate emotions.&mdash;With
a brutal in&#383;en&#383;ibility, he
cannot help di&#383;playing the plea&#383;ure
your determination to &#383;tay gives him,
in &#383;pite of the effect it is vi&#383;ible it has
had on me.</p>

<p>Till I can earn money, I &#383;hall endeavour
to borrow &#383;ome, for I want to
avoid a&#383;king him continually for the
&#383;um nece&#383;&#383;ary to maintain me.&mdash;Do not<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-114_S" id="CPg_3-114_S"></a>[<a href="images/v3-114.png">114</a>]</span>

away without &#383;peaking&mdash;&mdash;you mu&#383;t

power, and the recollection of which,
even di&#383;appointment cannot di&#383;enchant;

are not &#383;ufficiently &#383;trong to di&#383;&#383;ipate
the cloud, that de&#383;pair has &#383;pread
over futurity. I have looked at the
&#383;ea, and at my child, hardly daring to
own to my&#383;elf the &#383;ecret wi&#383;h, that it
might become our tomb; and that the
heart, &#383;till &#383;o alive to angui&#383;h, might
there be quieted by death. At this
moment ten thou&#383;and complicated &#383;entiments
pre&#383;s for utterance, weigh on
my heart, and ob&#383;cure my &#383;ight.</p>

<p>Are we ever to meet again? and will
you endeavour to render that meeting
happier than the la&#383;t? Will you endeavour
to re&#383;train your caprices, in order
to give vigour to affection, and to give
play to the checked &#383;entiments that
nature intended &#383;hould expand your
heart? I cannot indeed, without agony,
think of your bo&#383;om's being conti<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-131_S" id="CPg_3-131_S"></a>[<a href="images/v3-131.png">131</a>]</span>nually
contaminated; and bitter are
the tears which exhau&#383;t my eyes, when
I recollect why my child and I are
forced to &#383;tray from the a&#383;ylum, in
which, after &#383;o many &#383;torms, I had
hoped to re&#383;t, &#383;miling at angry fate.&mdash;The&#383;e
are not common &#383;orrows; nor
can you perhaps conceive, how much
active fortitude it requires to labour
perpetually to blunt the &#383;hafts of di&#383;appointment.</p>

<p>Examine now your&#383;elf, and a&#383;certain
whether you can live in &#383;omething-like
a &#383;ettled &#383;tile. Let our confidence
in future be unbounded; con&#383;ider whether
you find it nece&#383;&#383;ary to &#383;acrifice
me to what you term "the ze&#383;t of life;"
and, when you have once a clear view
of your own motives, of your own incentive
to action, do not deceive me!</p>

<p>The train of thoughts which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="CPg_3-132_S" id="CPg_3-132_S"></a>[<a href="images/v3-132.png">132</a>]</span>
writing of this epi&#383;tle awoke, makes
me &#383;o wretched, that I mu&#383;t take a
walk, to rou&#383;e and calm my mind.
But fir&#383;t, let me tell you, that, if you
really wi&#383;h to promote my happine&#383;s,
you will endeavour to give me as much
as you can of your&#383;elf. You have great
mental energy; and your judgment
&#383;eems to me &#383;o ju&#383;t, that it is only the
dupe of your inclination in di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ing

there is nothing I would not endure in
the way of privation, rather than di&#383;turb

to be unhappy, I will labour to hide
my &#383;orrows in my own bo&#383;om; and you
&#383;hall always find me a faithful, affectionate

<p>I grow more and more attached to

without fear, becau&#383;e it mu&#383;t be
a long time before it can become bitterne&#383;s
of &#383;oul.&mdash;She is an intere&#383;ting

nothing but the &#383;ight of her&mdash;her playful

<p>Love is a want of my heart. I have

is not to calm the mind&mdash;Aiming at
tranquillity, I have almo&#383;t de&#383;troyed all

<h4>LETTER LXVII</h4>

<p class="right">September 27.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> you receive this, I shall either
have landed, or be hovering on
the British coast&mdash;your letter of the 18th
decided me.</p>

<p>By what criterion of principle or affection,
you term my questions extraordinary
and unnecessary, I cannot determine.&mdash;You
desire me to decide&mdash;I<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-2" id="DPg_4-2"></a>[<a href="images/v4-2.png">2</a>]</span>
had decided. You must have had long
ago two letters of mine, from &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
to the same purport, to consider.&mdash;In
these, God knows! there was but too
much affection, and the agonies of a
distracted mind were but too faithfully
pourtrayed!&mdash;What more then had
I to say?&mdash;The negative was to come
from you.&mdash;You had perpetually recurred
to your promise of meeting me
in the autumn&mdash;Was it extraordinary
that I should demand a yes, or no?&mdash;Your
letter is written with extreme
harshness, coldness I am accustomed
to, in it I find not a trace of the tenderness
of humanity, much less of friendship.&mdash;I
only see a desire to heave a
load off your shoulders.</p>

<p>I am above disputing about words.&mdash;It
matters not in what terms you decide.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-3" id="DPg_4-3"></a>[<a href="images/v4-3.png">3</a>]</span>
The tremendous power who formed
this heart, must have foreseen that, in
a world in which self-interest, in various
shapes, is the principal mobile, I
had little chance of escaping misery.&mdash;To
the fiat of fate I submit.&mdash;I am content
to be wretched; but I will not be
contemptible.&mdash;Of me you have no
cause to complain, but for having had
too much regard for you&mdash;for having
expected a degree of permanent happiness,
when you only sought for a
momentary gratification.</p>

<p>I am strangely deficient in sagacity.&mdash;Uniting
myself to you, your tenderness
seemed to make me amends for all my
former misfortunes.&mdash;On this tenderness
and affection with what confidence
did I rest!&mdash;but I leaned on a spear, that
has pierced me to the heart.&mdash;You
have thrown off a faithful friend, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-4" id="DPg_4-4"></a>[<a href="images/v4-4.png">4</a>]</span>
pursue the caprices of the moment.&mdash;We
certainly are differently organized;
for even now, when conviction has
been stamped on my soul by sorrow, I
can scarcely believe it possible. It depends
at present on you, whether you
will see me or not.&mdash;I shall take no
step, till I see or hear from you.</p>

<p>Preparing myself for the worst&mdash;I
have determined, if your next letter be
like the last, to write to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
to procure me an obscure lodging, and
not to inform any body of my arrival.&mdash;There
I will endeavour in a few months
to obtain the sum necessary to take me
to France&mdash;from you I will not receive
any more.&mdash;I am not yet sufficiently
humbled to depend on your beneficence.</p>

<p>Some people, whom my unhappiness
has interested, though they know<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-5" id="DPg_4-5"></a>[<a href="images/v4-5.png">5</a>]</span>
not the extent of it, will assist me to
attain the object I have in view, the
independence of my child. Should a
peace take place, ready money will go
a great way in France&mdash;and I will borrow
a sum, which my industry <i>shall</i>
enable me to pay at my leisure, to purchase
a small estate for my girl.&mdash;The
assistance I shall find necessary to complete
her education, I can get at an
easy rate at Paris&mdash;I can introduce her
to such society as she will like&mdash;and
thus, securing for her all the chance
for happiness, which depends on me, I
shall die in peace, persuaded that the
felicity which has hitherto cheated
my expectation, will not always elude
my grasp. No poor tempest-tossed
mariner ever more earnestly longed to
arrive at his port.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-6" id="DPg_4-6"></a>[<a href="images/v4-6.png">6</a>]</span></p>
<p>I shall not come up in the vessel all
the way, because I have no place to go
to. Captain &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; will inform you
where I am. It is needless to add, that
I am not in a state of mind to bear suspense&mdash;and
that I wish to see you,
though it be for the last time.</p>

<hr />

<h4>LETTER LXVIII</h4>

<p class="right">Sunday, October 4.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I wrote</span> to you by the packet, to
inform you, that your letter of the 18th
of last month, had determined me to
set out with captain &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;; but, as
we sailed very quick, I take it for
granted, that you have not yet received
it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-7" id="DPg_4-7"></a>[<a href="images/v4-7.png">7</a>]</span>
You say, I must decide for myself.&mdash;I
had decided, that it was most for the
interest of my little girl, and for my
own comfort, little as I expect, for us
to live together; and I even thought
that you would be glad, some years
hence, when the tumult of business was
over, to repose in the society of an affectionate
friend, and mark the progress
of our interesting child, whilst endeavouring
to be of use in the circle you
at last resolved to rest in; for you cannot
run about for ever.</p>

<p>From the tenour of your last letter
however, I am led to imagine, that you
have formed some new attachment.&mdash;If
it be so, let me earnestly request you
to see me once more, and immediately.
This is the only proof I require of the
friendship you profess for me. I will<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-8" id="DPg_4-8"></a>[<a href="images/v4-8.png">8</a>]</span>
then decide, since you boggle about a
mere form.</p>

<p>I am labouring to write with calmness&mdash;but
the extreme anguish I feel,
at landing without having any friend
to receive me, and even to be conscious
that the friend whom I most wish
to see, will feel a disagreeable sensation
at being informed of my arrival, does
not come under the description of common
misery. Every emotion yields to
an overwhelming flood of sorrow&mdash;and
the playfulness of my child distresses
me.&mdash;On her account, I wished
to remain a few days here, comfortless
as is my situation.&mdash;Besides, I did not
wish to surprise you. You have told
me, that you would make any sacrifice
to promote my happiness&mdash;and, even in
your last unkind letter, you talk of the
ties which bind you to me and my<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-9" id="DPg_4-9"></a>[<a href="images/v4-9.png">9</a>]</span>
child.&mdash;Tell me, that you wish it, and
I will cut this Gordian knot.</p>

<p>I now most earnestly intreat you to
write to me, without fail, by the return
of the post. Direct your letter to
be left at the post-office, and tell me
whether you will come to me here, or
where you will meet me. I can receive
your letter on Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>Do not keep me in suspense.&mdash;I expect
nothing from you, or any human
being: my die is cast!&mdash;I have fortitude
enough to determine to do my
duty; yet I cannot raise my depressed
spirits, or calm my trembling heart.&mdash;That
being who moulded it thus,
knows that I am unable to tear up by
the roots the propensity to affection
which has been the torment of my life&mdash;but
life will have an end!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-10" id="DPg_4-10"></a>[<a href="images/v4-10.png">10</a>]</span>
Should you come here (a few months
ago I could not have doubted it) you
will find me at &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. If you prefer
meeting me on the road, tell me where.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I write</span> you now on my knees; imploring
you to send my child and the

Pray pay the cook her wages, and do
not mention the confession which I
forced from her&mdash;a little sooner or later
is of no consequence. Nothing but
my extreme stupidity could have rendered
me blind so long. Yet, whilst
you assured me that you had no attachment,
I thought we might still
have lived together.</p>

<p>I shall make no comments on your
conduct; or any appeal to the world.
Let my wrongs sleep with me! Soon,
very soon shall I be at peace. When
you receive this, my burning head will
be cold.</p>

<p>I would encounter a thousand deaths,
rather than a night like the last. Your
treatment has thrown my mind into a
state of chaos; yet I am serene. I go
to find comfort, and my only fear is,
that my poor body will be insulted by<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-12" id="DPg_4-12"></a>[<a href="images/v4-12.png">12</a>]</span>
an endeavour to recal my hated existence.
But I shall plunge into the
Thames where there is the least chance
of my being snatched from the death I
seek.</p>

<p>God bless you! May you never know
by experience what you have made me
endure. Should your sensibility ever
awake, remorse will find its way to your
heart; and, in the midst of business and
sensual pleasure, I shall appear before
you, the victim of your deviation from
rectitude.</p>

<h4>LETTER LXX</h4>

<p class="right">Sunday Morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> only to lament, that, when
the bitterness of death was past, I was
inhumanly brought back to life and
misery. But a fixed determination is
not to be baffled by disappointment;
nor will I allow that to be a frantic attempt,
which was one of the calmest
acts of reason. In this respect, I am
only accountable to myself. Did I
care for what is termed reputation, it
is by other circumstances that I should
be dishonoured.</p>

<p>You say, "that you know not how to
extricate ourselves out of the wretchedness
into which we have been plunged."<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-14" id="DPg_4-14"></a>[<a href="images/v4-14.png">14</a>]</span>
You are extricated long since.&mdash;But I
forbear to comment.&mdash;&mdash;If I am condemned
to live longer, it is a living
death.</p>

<p>It appears to me, that you lay much
more stress on delicacy, than on principle;
for I am unable to discover what
sentiment of delicacy would have been
violated, by your visiting a wretched
friend&mdash;if indeed you have any friendship
for me.&mdash;But since your new attachment
is the only thing sacred in
your eyes, I am silent&mdash;Be happy! My
complaints shall never more damp your
enjoyment&mdash;perhaps I am mistaken in
supposing that even my death could, for
more than a moment.&mdash;This is what
you call magnanimity&mdash;It is happy for
yourself, that you possess this quality in
the highest degree.</p>

<p>Your continually asserting, that you<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-15" id="DPg_4-15"></a>[<a href="images/v4-15.png">15</a>]</span>
will do all in your power to contribute
to my comfort (when you only allude
to pecuniary assistance), appears to me
a flagrant breach of delicacy.&mdash;I want
not such vulgar comfort, nor will I
accept it. I never wanted but your
heart&mdash;That gone, you have nothing
more to give. Had I only poverty to
fear, I should not shrink from life.&mdash;Forgive
me then, if I say, that I shall
consider any direct or indirect attempt
to supply my necessities, as an insult
which I have not merited&mdash;and as
rather done out of tenderness for your
own reputation, than for me. Do not
mistake me; I do not think that you
value money (therefore I will not accept
what you do not care for)
though I do much less, because certain
privations are not painful to me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-16" id="DPg_4-16"></a>[<a href="images/v4-16.png">16</a>]</span>

<h4>LETTER LXXV</h4>

<p class="right">London, November 27.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> letter, without an address,
which you put up with the letters you
returned, did not meet my eyes till
just now.&mdash;I had thrown the letters
aside&mdash;I did not wish to look over a
register of sorrow.</p>

<p>My not having seen it, will account
for my having written to you with
anger&mdash;under the impression your departure,
without even a line left for me,
made on me, even after your late conduct,
which could not lead me to expect
much attention to my sufferings.</p>

<p>In fact, "the decided conduct, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-23" id="DPg_4-23"></a>[<a href="images/v4-23.png">23</a>]</span>
appeared to me so unfeeling," has almost
overturned my reason; my mind
is injured&mdash;I scarcely know where I
am, or what I do.&mdash;The grief I cannot
conquer (for some cruel recollections
never quit me, banishing almost every
other) I labour to conceal in total
solitude.&mdash;My life therefore is but an
exercise of fortitude, continually on
the stretch&mdash;and hope never gleams in
this tomb, where I am buried alive.</p>

<p>But I meant to reason with you, and
not to complain.&mdash;You tell me, "that I
shall judge more coolly of your mode
of acting, some time hence." But is it
not possible that <i>passion</i> clouds your reason,
as much as it does mine?&mdash;and
ought you not to doubt, whether those
principles are so "exalted," as you
term them, which only lead to your
own gratification? In other words,<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-24" id="DPg_4-24"></a>[<a href="images/v4-24.png">24</a>]</span>
whether it be just to have no principle
of action, but that of following your
inclination, trampling on the affection
you have fostered, and the expectations
you have excited?</p>

<p>My affection for you is rooted in my
heart.&mdash;I know you are not what you
now seem&mdash;nor will you always act, or
feel, as you now do, though I may
never be comforted by the change.&mdash;Even
at Paris, my image will haunt
you.&mdash;You will see my pale face&mdash;and
sometimes the tears of anguish will
drop on your heart, which you have
forced from mine.</p>

<p>I cannot write. I thought I could
quickly have refuted all your <i>ingenious</i>
arguments; but my head is confused.&mdash;Right
or wrong, I am miserable!</p>

<p>It seems to me, that my conduct has
always been governed by the strictest
principles of justice and truth.&mdash;Yet,<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-25" id="DPg_4-25"></a>[<a href="images/v4-25.png">25</a>]</span>
how wretched have my social feelings,
and delicacy of sentiment rendered me!&mdash;I
have loved with my whole soul,
only to discover that I had no chance
of a return&mdash;and that existence is a
burthen without it.</p>

<p>I do not perfectly understand you.&mdash;If,
by the offer of your friendship, you
still only mean pecuniary support&mdash;I
must again reject it.&mdash;Trifling are the
ills of poverty in the scale of my misfortunes.&mdash;God
bless you!</p>

<p class="right">* * * *</p>

<p>I have been treated ungenerously&mdash;if
I understand what is generosity.&mdash;&mdash;You
seem to me only to have been
anxious to shake me off&mdash;regardless
whether you dashed me to atoms by
the fall.&mdash;In truth I have been rudely
handled. <i>Do you judge coolly</i>, and I trust<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-26" id="DPg_4-26"></a>[<a href="images/v4-26.png">26</a>]</span>
you will not continue to call those capricious
feelings "the most refined,"
which would undermine not only the
most sacred principles, but the affections
which unite mankind.&mdash;&mdash;You
would render mothers unnatural&mdash;and
there would be no such thing as a father!&mdash;If
your theory of morals is the
most "exalted," it is certainly the most
easy.&mdash;It does not require much magnanimity,
to determine to please ourselves
for the moment, let others suffer
what they will!</p>

<p>Excuse me for again tormenting you,
my heart thirsts for justice from you&mdash;and
whilst I recollect that you approved
Miss &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s conduct&mdash;I am convinced
you will not always justify your
own.</p>

<p>Beware of the deceptions of passion!
It will not always banish from your<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-27" id="DPg_4-27"></a>[<a href="images/v4-27.png">27</a>]</span>
mind, that you have acted ignobly&mdash;and
condescended to subterfuge to
gloss over the conduct you could not
excuse.&mdash;Do truth and principle require
such sacrifices?</p>

with the keen anguish I do at present&mdash;for
I began even now to write calmly,

ask yourself if you have not condescended
to employ a little address, I
could almost say cunning, unworthy of
you?&mdash;Principles are sacred things&mdash;and
we never play with truth, with
impunity.</p>

<p>The expectation (I have too fondly
nourished it) of regaining your affection,
every day grows fainter and
fainter.&mdash;Indeed, it seems to me, when

never see you more.&mdash;Yet you will not
always forget me.&mdash;You will feel something
like remorse, for having lived only
for yourself&mdash;and sacrificed my peace
to inferior gratifications. In a comfortless
old age, you will remember
that you had one disinterested friend,
whose heart you wounded to the quick.
The hour of recollection will come&mdash;and
you will not be satisfied to act the
part of a boy, till you fall into that of a
dotard. I know that your mind, your
heart, and your principles of action,
are all superior to your present conduct.
You do, you must, respect me&mdash;and
you will be sorry to forfeit my esteem.</p>

<p>You know best whether I am still
preserving the remembrance of an
imaginary being.&mdash;I once thought that
I knew you thoroughly&mdash;but now I
am obliged to leave some doubts that<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-30" id="DPg_4-30"></a>[<a href="images/v4-30.png">30</a>]</span>
involuntarily press on me, to be cleared
up by time.</p>

<p>You may render me unhappy; but
cannot make me contemptible in my
own eyes.&mdash;I shall still be able to support
my child, though I am disappointed
in some other plans of usefulness,
which I once believed would have afforded
you equal pleasure.</p>

<p>Whilst I was with you, I restrained
my natural generosity, because I thought
your property in jeopardy.&mdash;When I
went to &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, I requested you, <i>if you
could conveniently</i>, not to forget my father,
sisters, and some other people,
whom I was interested about.&mdash;Money
was lavished away, yet not only my
requests were neglected, but some trifling
debts were not discharged, that
now come on me.&mdash;Was this friendship&mdash;or
generosity? Will you not grant<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-31" id="DPg_4-31"></a>[<a href="images/v4-31.png">31</a>]</span>

not the language of truth and feeling

know that it is impossible
for you always to confound the
caprices of every wayward inclination

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-32" id="DPg_4-32"></a>[<a href="images/v4-32.png">32</a>]</span>
You tell me "that I torment you."&mdash;Why
do I?&mdash;&mdash;Because you cannot
estrange your heart entirely from me&mdash;and
you feel that justice is on my side.
You urge, "that your conduct was
unequivocal."&mdash;It was not.&mdash;When
your coolness has hurt me, with what
tenderness have you endeavoured to
remove the impression!&mdash;and even before
I returned to England, you took
great pains to convince me, that all
my uneasiness was occasioned by the
effect of a worn-out constitution&mdash;and
you concluded your letter with these
words, "Business alone has kept me
from you.&mdash;Come to any port, and I
will fly down to my two dear girls
with a heart all their own."</p>

<p>With these assurances, is it extraordinary
that I should believe what I
wished? I might&mdash;and did think that<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-33" id="DPg_4-33"></a>[<a href="images/v4-33.png">33</a>]</span>
you had a struggle with old propensities;

that you had a magnanimity of character,

yourself.</p>

romance, you have acknowledged to
me feelings of this kind.&mdash;You could
restore me to life and hope, and the
satisfaction you would feel, would
amply repay you.</p>

<p>In tearing myself from you, it is my
own heart I pierce&mdash;and the time will
come, when you will lament that you
have thrown away a heart, that, even
in the moment of passion, you cannot
despise.&mdash;I would owe every thing to
your generosity&mdash;but, for God's sake,

disdain to utter a reproach, though I
have had reason to think, that the
"forbearance" talked of, has not been
very delicate.&mdash;It is however of no
consequence.&mdash;I am glad you are satisfied

That there is "sophistry" on one
side or other, is certain; but now it
matters not on which. On my part it
has not been a question of words. Yet
your understanding or mine must be
strangely warped&mdash;for what you term
"delicacy," appears to me to be exactly
the contrary. I have no criterion
for morality, and have thought in vain,
if the sensations which lead you to follow
an ancle or step, be the sacred
foundation of principle and affection.
Mine has been of a very different nature,
or it would not have stood the
brunt of your sarcasms.</p>

<p>The sentiment in me is still sacred.
If there be any part of me that will
survive the sense of my misfortunes, it
is the purity of my affections. The
impetuosity of your senses, may have
led you to term mere animal desire, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-36" id="DPg_4-36"></a>[<a href="images/v4-36.png">36</a>]</span>

<h3><a name="LETTER" id="DLETTER"></a>LETTER</h3>

<h3><i>Introductory to a Series of Letters on the Present
Character of the French Nation.</i></h3>
<hr class="short" />

<p class="right">Paris, February 15, 1793.</p>

<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; My dear friend,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is necessary perhaps for an observer
of mankind, to guard as carefully the
remembrance of the first impression
made by a nation, as by a countenance;
because we imperceptibly lose sight of
the national character, when we become
more intimate with individuals.
It is not then useless or presumptuous
to note, that, when I first entered Paris,<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-40" id="DPg_4-40"></a>[<a href="images/v4-40.png">40</a>]</span>
the striking contrast of riches and poverty,
elegance and slovenliness, urbanity
and deceit, every where caught
my eye, and saddened my soul; and
these impressions are still the foundation
of my remarks on the manners, which
flatter the senses, more than they interest
the heart, and yet excite more interest
than esteem.</p>

<p>The whole mode of life here tends
indeed to render the people frivolous,
and, to borrow their favourite epithet,
amiable. Ever on the wing, they are
always sipping the sparkling joy on the
brim of the cup, leaving satiety in the
bottom for those who venture to drink
deep. On all sides they trip along,
buoyed up by animal spirits, and seemingly
so void of care, that often, when
I am walking on the <i>Boulevards</i>, it
occurs to me, that they alone understand<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-41" id="DPg_4-41"></a>[<a href="images/v4-41.png">41</a>]</span>
the full import of the term leisure; and
they trifle their time away with such
an air of contentment, I know not how
to wish them wiser at the expence of
their gaiety. They play before me like
motes in a sunbeam, enjoying the passing
ray; whilst an English head, searching
for more solid happiness, loses, in
the analysis of pleasure, the volatile
sweets of the moment. Their chief
enjoyment, it is true, rises from vanity:
but it is not the vanity that engenders
vexation of spirit; on the contrary, it
lightens the heavy burthen of life,
which reason too often weighs, merely
to shift from one shoulder to the
other.</p>

<p>Investigating the modification of the
passion, as I would analyze the elements
that give a form to dead matter, I
shall attempt to trace to their source<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-42" id="DPg_4-42"></a>[<a href="images/v4-42.png">42</a>]</span>
the causes which have combined to
render this nation the most polished, in
a physical sense, and probably the most
superficial in the world; and I mean to
follow the windings of the various
streams that disembogue into a terrific
gulf, in which all the dignity of our
nature is absorbed. For every thing
has conspired to make the French the
most sensual people in the world; and
what can render the heart so hard, or
so effectually stifle every moral emotion,
as the refinements of sensuality?</p>

<p>The frequent repetition of the word
French, appears invidious; let me then
make a previous observation, which I
beg you not to lose sight of, when I
speak rather harshly of a land flowing
with milk and honey. Remember that
it is not the morals of a particular
people that I would decry; for are we<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-43" id="DPg_4-43"></a>[<a href="images/v4-43.png">43</a>]</span>
not all of the same stock? But I wish
calmly to consider the stage of civilization
in which I find the French, and,
giving a sketch of their character, and
unfolding the circumstances which have
produced its identity, I shall endeavour
to throw some light on the history of
man, and on the present important
subjects of discussion.</p>

<p>I would I could first inform you that,
out of the chaos of vices and follies,
prejudices and virtues, rudely jumbled
together, I saw the fair form of Liberty
slowly rising, and Virtue expanding her
wings to shelter all her children! I
should then hear the account of the
barbarities that have rent the bosom of
France patiently, and bless the firm
hand that lopt off the rotten limbs.
But, if the aristocracy of birth is levelled
with the ground, only to make room<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-44" id="DPg_4-44"></a>[<a href="images/v4-44.png">44</a>]</span>
for that of riches, I am afraid that the
morals of the people will not be much
improved by the change, or the government
rendered less venal. Still it
is not just to dwell on the misery produced
by the present struggle, without
adverting to the standing evils of the
old system. I am grieved&mdash;sorely grieved&mdash;when
I think of the blood that has
stained the cause of freedom at Paris;
but I also hear the same live stream cry
aloud from the highways, through
which the retreating armies passed
with famine and death in their rear,
and I hide my face with awe before
the inscrutable ways of providence,
sweeping in such various directions the
besom of destruction over the sons of
men.</p>

<p>Before I came to France, I cherished,
you know, an opinion, that strong vir<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-45" id="DPg_4-45"></a>[<a href="images/v4-45.png">45</a>]</span>tues
might exist with the polished manners
produced by the progress of civilization;
and I even anticipated the
epoch, when, in the course of improvement,
men would labour to become
virtuous, without being goaded on by
misery. But now, the perspective of
the golden age, fading before the attentive
eye of observation, almost eludes
my sight; and, losing thus in part my
theory of a more perfect state, start not,
my friend, if I bring forward an opinion,
which at the first glance seems to
be levelled against the existence of God!
I am not become an Atheist, I assure
you, by residing at Paris: yet I begin
to fear that vice, or, if you will, evil,
is the grand mobile of action, and that,
when the passions are justly poized, we
become harmless, and in the same proportion
useless.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-46" id="DPg_4-46"></a>[<a href="images/v4-46.png">46</a>]</span>
The wants of reason are very few;
and, were we to consider dispassionately
the real value of most things, we should
probably rest satisfied with the simple
gratification of our physical necessities,
and be content with negative goodness:
for it is frequently, only that wanton,
the Imagination, with her artful
coquetry, who lures us forward, and
makes us run over a rough road, pushing
aside every obstacle merely to catch
a disappointment.</p>

<p>The desire also of being useful to
others, is continually damped by experience;
and, if the exertions of humanity
were not in some measure their
own reward, who would endure misery,
or struggle with care, to make
some people ungrateful, and others
idle?</p>

<p>You will call these melancholy effu<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-47" id="DPg_4-47"></a>[<a href="images/v4-47.png">47</a>]</span>sions,
and guess that, fatigued by the
vivacity, which has all the bustling
folly of childhood, without the innocence
which renders ignorance charming,
I am too severe in my strictures.
It may be so; and I am aware that the
good effects of the revolution will be
last felt at Paris; where surely the soul
of Epicurus has long been at work to
root out the simple emotions of the
heart, which, being natural, are always
moral. Rendered cold and artificial
by the selfish enjoyments of the senses,
which the government fostered, is it
surprising that simplicity of manners,
and singleness of heart, rarely appear,
to recreate me with the wild odour of
nature, so passing sweet?</p>

<p>Seeing how deep the fibres of mischief
have shot, I sometimes ask, with a
doubting accent, Whether a nation can<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-48" id="DPg_4-48"></a>[<a href="images/v4-48.png">48</a>]</span>
go back to the purity of manners which
has hitherto been maintained unsullied
only by the keen air of poverty, when,
emasculated by pleasure, the luxuries
of prosperity are become the wants of
nature? I cannot yet give up the hope,
that a fairer day is dawning on Europe,
though I must hesitatingly observe, that
little is to be expected from the narrow
principle of commerce which seems
every where to be shoving aside <i>the point
of honour</i> of the <i>noblesse</i>. I can look beyond
the evils of the moment, and do
not expect muddied water to become
clear before it has had time to stand;
yet, even for the moment, it is the
most terrific of all sights, to see men
vicious without warmth&mdash;to see the
order that should be the superscription
of virtue, cultivated to give security to
crimes which only thoughtlessness could<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-49" id="DPg_4-49"></a>[<a href="images/v4-49.png">49</a>]</span>
palliate. Disorder is, in fact, the very
essence of vice, though with the wild
wishes of a corrupt fancy humane emotions
often kindly mix to soften their
atrocity. Thus humanity, generosity,
and even self-denial, sometimes render
a character grand, and even useful,
when hurried away by lawless passions;
but what can equal the turpitude of a
cold calculator who lives for himself
alone, and considering his fellow-creatures
merely as machines of pleasure,
never forgets that honesty is the best policy?
Keeping ever within the pale of
the law, he crushes his thousands with
impunity; but it is with that degree of
management, which makes him, to borrow
a significant vulgarism, a villain
<i>in grain</i>. The very excess of his depravation
preserves him, whilst the more
respectable beast of prey, who prowls<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-50" id="DPg_4-50"></a>[<a href="images/v4-50.png">50</a>]</span>
about like the lion, and roars to announce
his approach, falls into a snare.</p>

<p>You may think it too soon to form
an opinion of the future government,
yet it is impossible to avoid hazarding
some conjectures, when every thing
whispers me, that names, not principles,
are changed, and when I see that
the turn of the tide has left the dregs of
the old system to corrupt the new. For
the same pride of office, the same desire
of power are still visible; with this aggravation,
that, fearing to return to obscurity
after having but just acquired
a relish for distinction, each hero, or
philosopher, for all are dubbed with
these new titles, endeavours to make
hay while the sun shines; and every
petty municipal officer, become the idol,
or rather the tyrant of the day, stalks
like a cock on a dunghil.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-51" id="DPg_4-51"></a>[<a href="images/v4-51.png">51</a>]</span>
I shall now conclude this desultory
letter; which however will enable you
to foresee that I shall treat more of
morals than manners.</p>

<hr />

<h4>LETTER I</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">I ought</span> to apologize for not having
written to you on the subject you
mentioned; but, to tell you the truth,
it grew upon me: and, instead of an
answer, I have begun a series of letters
on the management of children in
their infancy. Replying then to your
question, I have the public in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-56" id="DPg_4-56"></a>[<a href="images/v4-56.png">56</a>]</span>
thoughts, and shall endeavour to show
what modes appear to me necessary,
to render the infancy of children more
healthy and happy. I have long
thought, that the cause which renders
children as hard to rear as the most
fragile plant, is our deviation from
simplicity. I know that some able
physicians have recommended the method
I have pursued, and I mean to
point out the good effects I have observed
in practice. I am aware that
many matrons will exclaim against me,
and dwell on the number of children
they have brought up, as their mothers
did before them, without troubling
themselves with new-fangled notions;
yet, though, in my uncle Toby's words,
they should attempt to silence me, by
"wishing I had seen their large" families,
I must suppose, while a third part<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-57" id="DPg_4-57"></a>[<a href="images/v4-57.png">57</a>]</span>
of the human species, according to the
most accurate calculation, die during
their infancy, just at the threshold of
life, that there is some error in the
modes adopted by mothers and nurses,
which counteracts their own endeavours.
I may be mistaken in some
particulars; for general rules, founded
on the soundest reason, demand individual
modification; but, if I can persuade
any of the rising generation to
exercise their reason on this head, I am
content. My advice will probably
be found most useful to mothers in the
middle class; and it is from them that
the lower imperceptibly gains improvement.
Custom, produced by reason
in one, may safely be the effect of
imitation in the other.</p>

<h4>LETTER I</h4>

<p class="right">Dublin, April 14, [1787.]</p>

<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; Dear sir,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> still an invalid&mdash;and begin to
believe that I ought never to expect to
enjoy health. My mind preys on my
body&mdash;and, when I endeavour to be
useful, I grow too much interested for
my own peace. Confined almost entirely
to the society of children, I am
anxiously solicitous for their future
welfare, and mortified beyond measure,<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-62" id="DPg_4-62"></a>[<a href="images/v4-62.png">62</a>]</span>
when counteracted in my endeavours to
improve them.&mdash;I feel all a mother's
fears for the swarm of little ones which
surround me, and observe disorders,
without having power to apply the
proper remedies. How can I be reconciled
to life, when it is always a
painful warfare, and when I am deprived
of all the pleasures I relish?&mdash;I
allude to rational conversations, and
domestic affections. Here, alone, a
poor solitary individual in a strange
land, tied to one spot, and subject to
the caprice of another, can I be contented?
I am desirous to convince you
that I have <i>some</i> cause for sorrow&mdash;and
am not without reason detached from
life. I shall hope to hear that you are
well, and am yours sincerely</p>

<h4>LETTER II</h4>

<p class="right">Henley, Thursday, Sept 13.</p>

<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; My dear sir,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> I saw you, I have, literally
speaking, <i>enjoyed</i> solitude. My sister
could not accompany me in my rambles;
I therefore wandered alone, by
the side of the Thames, and in the
neighbouring beautiful fields and
pleasure grounds: the prospects were
of such a placid kind, I <i>caught</i> tranquillity
while I surveyed them&mdash;my mind
was <i>still</i>, though active. Were I to
give you an account how I have spent
my time, you would smile.&mdash;I found an
old French bible here, and amused
myself with comparing it with our<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-64" id="DPg_4-64"></a>[<a href="images/v4-64.png">64</a>]</span>
English translation; then I would listen
to the falling leaves, or observe the
various tints the autumn gave to
them&mdash;At other times, the singing of
a robin, or the noise of a water-mill,
engaged my attention&mdash;partial attention&mdash;,
for I was, at the same time
perhaps discussing some knotty point,
or straying from this <i>tiny</i> world to new
systems. After these excursions, I returned
to the family meals, told the
children stories (they think me <i>vastly</i>
agreeable), and my sister was amused.&mdash;Well,
will you allow me to call this
way of passing my days pleasant?</p>

<p>I was just going to mend my pen;
but I believe it will enable me to say
all I have to add to this epistle. Have
you yet heard of an habitation for me?
I often think of my new plan of life;
and, lest my sister should try to prevail<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-65" id="DPg_4-65"></a>[<a href="images/v4-65.png">65</a>]</span>
on me to alter it, I have avoided mentioning
it to her. I am determined!&mdash;Your
sex generally laugh at female
determinations; but let me tell you,
I never yet resolved to do, any thing of
consequence, that I did not adhere resolutely
to it, till I had accomplished
my purpose, improbable as it might
have appeared to a more timid mind.
In the course of near nine-and-twenty
years, I have gathered some experience,
and felt many <i>severe</i> disappointments&mdash;and
what is the amount? I long for a
little peace and <i>independence</i>! Every
obligation we receive from our fellow-creatures
is a new shackle, takes from
our native freedom, and debases the
mind, makes us mere earthworms&mdash;I
am not fond of grovelling!</p>

<p class="right">I am, sir, yours, &amp;c.&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">mary wollstonecraft.</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-66" id="DPg_4-66"></a>[<a href="images/v4-66.png">66</a>]</span></p>
<h4>LETTER III</h4>

<p class="right">Market Harborough, Sept. 20.</p>

<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; My dear sir,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> left me with three opulent
tradesmen; their conversation was not
calculated to beguile the way, when
the sable curtain concealed the beauties
of nature. I listened to the tricks
of trade&mdash;and shrunk away, without
wishing to grow rich; even the novelty
of the subjects did not render them
pleasing; fond as I am of tracing the
passions in all their different forms&mdash;I
was not surprised by any glimpse of the
sublime, or beautiful&mdash;though one of
them imagined I would be a useful partner
in a good <i>firm</i>. I was very much
fatigued, and have scarcely recovered<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-67" id="DPg_4-67"></a>[<a href="images/v4-67.png">67</a>]</span>
myself. I do not expect to enjoy the
same tranquil pleasures Henley afforded:
I meet with new objects to employ
my mind; but many painful emotions
are complicated with the reflections
they give rise to.</p>

<p>I do not intend to enter on the <i>old</i>
topic, yet hope to hear from you&mdash;and
am yours, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">mary wollstonecraft.</span></p>

<hr />

<h4>LETTER IV</h4>

<p class="right">Friday Night.</p>

<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; My dear sir,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> your remarks are generally
judicious&mdash;I cannot <i>now</i> concur with you,
I mean with respect to the preface<a name="FNanchor_67-A_21" id="DFNanchor_67-A_21"></a><a href="#DFootnote_67-A_21" class="fnanchor">[67-A]</a>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-68" id="DPg_4-68"></a>[<a href="images/v4-68.png">68</a>]</span>
and have not altered it. I hate the
usual smooth way of exhibiting proud
humility. A general rule <i>only</i> extends
to the majority&mdash;and, believe me, the
few judicious parents who may peruse
my book, will not feel themselves hurt&mdash;and
the weak are too vain to mind what
is said in a book intended for children.</p>

<p>I return you the Italian MS.&mdash;but
do not hastily imagine that I am indolent.
I would not spare any labour to
do my duty&mdash;and, after the most laborious
day, that single thought would
solace me more than any pleasures the
senses could enjoy. I find I could not
translate the MS. well. If it was not
a MS, I should not be so easily intimidated;
but the hand, and errors in
orthography, or abbreviations, are a
stumbling-block at the first setting
out.&mdash;I cannot bear to do any thing I<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-69" id="DPg_4-69"></a>[<a href="images/v4-69.png">69</a>]</span>
cannot do well&mdash;and I should lose time
in the vain attempt.</p>

<p>I had, the other day, the satisfaction
of again receiving a letter from my
poor, dear Margaret<a name="FNanchor_69-A_22" id="DFNanchor_69-A_22"></a><a href="#DFootnote_69-A_22" class="fnanchor">[69-A]</a>.&mdash;With all a
mother's fondness I could transcribe a
part of it&mdash;She says, every day her
affection to me, and dependence on
heaven increase, &amp;c.&mdash;I miss her
innocent caresses&mdash;and sometimes indulge
a pleasing hope, that she may be
allowed to cheer my childless age&mdash;if
I am to live to be old.&mdash;At any rate, I
may hear of the virtues I may not contemplate&mdash;and
my reason may permit
me to love a female.&mdash;I now allude to
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. I have received another letter
from her, and her childish complaints
vex me&mdash;indeed they do&mdash;As
usual, good-night.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">mary.</span></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-70" id="DPg_4-70"></a>[<a href="images/v4-70.png">70</a>]</span></p>
<p>If parents attended to their children,
I would not have written the stories;
for, what are books&mdash;compared to conversations
which affection inforces!&mdash;</p>

<hr />

<h4>LETTER V</h4>

<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; My dear sir,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remember</span> you are to settle <i>my account</i>,
as I want to know how much I
am in your debt&mdash;but do not suppose
that I feel any uneasiness on that score.
The generality of people in trade
would not be much obliged to me for a
like civility, <i>but you were a man</i> before
you were a bookseller&mdash;so I am your
sincere friend,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">mary.</span></p>

<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-71" id="DPg_4-71"></a>[<a href="images/v4-71.png">71</a>]</span></p>
<h4>LETTER VI</h4>

<p class="right">Friday Morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> sick with vexation&mdash;and wish
I could knock my foolish head against
the wall, that bodily pain might make
me feel less anguish from self-reproach!
To say the truth, I was never more displeased
with myself, and I will tell you
the cause.&mdash;You may recollect that I
did not mention to you the circumstance
of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; having a fortune left
to him; nor did a hint of it drop from
me when I conversed with my sister;
because I knew he had a sufficient motive
for concealing it. Last Sunday,
when his character was aspersed, as I
thought, unjustly, in the heat of vindi<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-72" id="DPg_4-72"></a>[<a href="images/v4-72.png">72</a>]</span>cation
I informed ****** that he was
now independent; but, at the same
time, desired him not to repeat my information
to B&mdash;&mdash;; yet, last Tuesday,
he told him all&mdash;and the boy at B&mdash;&mdash;'s
gave Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; an account of it. As
Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; knew he had only made a
confident of me (I blush to think of it!)
he guessed the channel of intelligence,
and this morning came (not to reproach
me, I wish he had!) but to point out the
injury I have done him.&mdash;Let what will
be the consequence, I will reimburse
him, if I deny myself the necessaries of
life&mdash;and even then my folly will sting
me.&mdash;Perhaps you can scarcely conceive
the misery I at this moment
endure&mdash;that I, whose power of doing
good is so limited, should do harm, galls
my very soul. ****** may laugh at
these qualms&mdash;but, supposing Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-73" id="DPg_4-73"></a>[<a href="images/v4-73.png">73</a>]</span>
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; to be unworthy, I am not
the less to blame. Surely it is hell to
despise one's self!&mdash;I did not want this
additional vexation&mdash;at this time I have
many that hang heavily on my spirits.
I shall not call on you this month&mdash;nor
stir out.&mdash;My stomach has been so suddenly
and violently affected, I am
unable to lean over the desk.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">mary wollstonecraft.</span></p>

<hr />

<h4>LETTER VII</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> I am become a reviewer, I think
it right, in the way of business, to consider
the subject. You have alarmed
the editor of the Critical, as the advertisement
prefixed to the Appendix<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-74" id="DPg_4-74"></a>[<a href="images/v4-74.png">74</a>]</span>
plainly shows. The Critical appears
to me to be a timid, mean production,
and its success is a reflection on the
taste and judgment of the public; but,
as a body, who ever gave it credit for
much? The voice of the people is only
the voice of truth, when some man of
abilities has had time to get fast hold of
the <span class="smcap">great nose</span> of the monster. Of
course, local fame is generally a
clamour, and dies away. The Appendix
to the Monthly afforded me more
amusement, though every article almost
wants energy and a <i>cant</i> of virtue and
liberality is strewed over it; always
tame, and eager to pay court to established
fame. The account of Necker
is one unvaried tone of admiration.
Surely men were born only to provide
for the sustenance of the body by enfeebling
the mind!</p>

<h4>LETTER VIII</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> made me very low-spirited last
night, by your manner of talking.&mdash;You
are my only friend&mdash;the only
person I am <i>intimate</i> with.&mdash;I never had
a father, or a brother&mdash;you have been
both to me, ever since I knew you&mdash;yet
I have sometimes been very petulant.&mdash;I
have been thinking of those instances
of ill-humour and quickness, and they
appeared like crimes.</p>

<p class="right">Yours sincerely &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-76" id="DPg_4-76"></a>[<a href="images/v4-76.png">76</a>]</span></p>
<h4>LETTER IX</h4>

<p class="right">Saturday Night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> a mere animal, and instinctive
emotions too often silence the suggestions
of reason. Your note&mdash;I can
scarcely tell why, hurt me&mdash;and produced
a kind of winterly smile, which
diffuses a beam of despondent tranquillity
over the features. I have been
very ill&mdash;Heaven knows it was more
than fancy&mdash;After some sleepless, wearisome
nights, towards the morning I
have grown delirious.&mdash;Last Thursday,
in particular, I imagined &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; was
thrown into great distress by his folly;
and I, unable to assist him, was in an
agony. My nerves were in such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-77" id="DPg_4-77"></a>[<a href="images/v4-77.png">77</a>]</span>
painful state of irritation&mdash;I suffered
more than I can express&mdash;Society was
necessary&mdash;and might have diverted
me till I gained more strength; but I
blushed when I recollected how often
I had teazed you with childish complaints,
and the reveries of a disordered
imagination. I even <i>imagined</i> that I
intruded on you, because you never
called on me&mdash;though you perceived
that I was not well.&mdash;I have nourished
a sickly kind of delicacy, which gives
me many unnecessary pangs.&mdash;I acknowledge
that life is but a jest&mdash;and
often a frightful dream&mdash;yet catch
myself every day searching for something
serious&mdash;and feel real misery
from the disappointment. I am a
strange compound of weakness and resolution!
However, if I must suffer, I
will endeavour to suffer in silence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-78" id="DPg_4-78"></a>[<a href="images/v4-78.png">78</a>]</span>
There is certainly a great defect in my
mind&mdash;my wayward heart creates its
own misery&mdash;Why I am made thus I

idea of the whole of my existence, I

tired of it as soon as I get it.</p>

<p>We must each of us wear a fool's
cap; but mine, alas! has lost its bells,

troublesome.&mdash;&mdash;Good-night!

strange thoughts since I began to write,

laughed immoderately&mdash;Surely I am a
fool&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I thought</span> you <i>very</i> unkind, nay,
very unfeeling, last night. My cares
and vexations&mdash;I will say what I allow
myself to think&mdash;do me honour, as they
arise from my disinterestedness and <i>unbending</i>
principles; nor can that mode
of conduct be a reflection on my understanding,
which enables me to bear
misery, rather than selfishly live for myself
alone. I am not the only character
deserving of respect, that has had to
struggle with various sorrows&mdash;while
inferior minds have enjoyed local fame
and present comfort.&mdash;Dr. Johnson's
cares almost drove him mad&mdash;but, I
suppose, you would quietly have told

stream, can yet be in good humour. I
have done with insensible human wisdom,&mdash;"indifference
cold in wisdom's
guise,"&mdash;and turn to the source of perfection&mdash;who
perhaps never disregarded
an almost broken heart, especially when
a respect, a practical respect, for virtue,
sharpened the wounds of adversity. I

getting money to extricate myself out

intimacy with Miss &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; gave him a
privilege, which he should not have assumed

made to his cousin, a milliner's girl,
which should not have been mentioned
to me. Pray tell him that I am offended&mdash;and
do not wish to see him again!&mdash;When
I meet him at your house, I shall
leave the room, since I cannot pull him
by the nose. I can force my spirit to
leave my body&mdash;but it shall never bend

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> you left me this morning, and
I reflected a moment&mdash;your <i>officious</i>
message, which at first appeared to me
a joke&mdash;looked so very like an insult&mdash;I
cannot forget it&mdash;To prevent then the

<h4>LETTER XIII</h4>

<p class="right">Wednesday, 3 o'clock.</p>

<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; Sir,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is inexpressibly disagreeable to me
to be obliged to enter again on a subject,
that has already raised a tumult of
<i>indignant</i> emotions in my bosom, which
I was labouring to suppress when I received
your letter. I shall now <i>condescend</i>
to answer your epistle; but let me
first tell you, that, in my <i>unprotected</i> situation,
I make a point of never forgiving
a <i>deliberate insult</i>&mdash;and in that light I
consider your late officious conduct.
It is not according to my nature to
mince matters&mdash;I will then tell you in<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-86" id="DPg_4-86"></a>[<a href="images/v4-86.png">86</a>]</span>
plain terms, what I think. I have ever
considered you in the light of a <i>civil</i>
acquaintance&mdash;on the word friend I lay
a peculiar emphasis&mdash;and, as a mere
acquaintance, you were rude and <i>cruel</i>,
to step forward to insult a woman,
whose conduct and misfortunes demand
respect. If my friend, Mr. Johnson,
had made the proposal&mdash;I should have
been severely hurt&mdash;have thought him
unkind and unfeeling, but not <i>impertinent</i>.&mdash;The
privilege of intimacy you
had no claim to&mdash;and should have referred
the man to myself&mdash;if you had
not sufficient discernment to quash it at
once. I am, sir, poor and destitute.&mdash;Yet
I have a spirit that will never bend,
or take indirect methods, to obtain the
consequence I despise; nay, if to support
life it was necessary to act contrary
to my principles, the struggle<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-87" id="DPg_4-87"></a>[<a href="images/v4-87.png">87</a>]</span>
would soon be over. I can bear any
thing but my own contempt.</p>

<p>In a few words, what I call an insult,
is the bare supposition that I could for
a moment think of <i>prostituting</i> my person
for a maintenance; for in that point of
view does such a marriage appear to
me, who consider right and wrong in
the abstract, and never by words and
local opinions shield myself from the
reproaches of my own heart and understanding.</p>

<p>It is needless to say more&mdash;Only you
must excuse me when I add, that I wish
never to see, but as a perfect stranger,
a person who could so grossly mistake
my character. An apology is not necessary&mdash;if
you were inclined to make
one&mdash;nor any further expostulations.&mdash;I
again repeat, I cannot overlook an
affront; few indeed have sufficient de<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-88" id="DPg_4-88"></a>[<a href="images/v4-88.png">88</a>]</span>licacy
to respect poverty, even where
it gives lustre to a character&mdash;and I tell
you sir, I am <span class="smcap">poor</span>&mdash;yet can live without
your benevolent exertions.</p>

<h4>LETTER XIV</h4>

over any more trash this month&mdash;you
must send it directly. I have been so

want some paper&mdash;you may as well
send it at the same time&mdash;for I am trying
to brace my nerves that I may be
industrious.&mdash;I am afraid reason is not a
good bracer&mdash;for I have been reasoning
a long time with my untoward spirits&mdash;and
yet my hand trembles.&mdash;I could

add that I am yours sincerely,</p>

will not have often to say&mdash;what does

head and ears in debt; but I have not
that kind of pride, which makes some
dislike to be obliged to those they respect.&mdash;On
the contrary, when I involuntarily
lament that I have not a father
or brother, I thankfully recollect that
I have received unexpected kindness
from you and a few others.&mdash;So reason
allows, what nature impels me to&mdash;for
I cannot live without loving my fellow-creatures&mdash;nor
can I love them, without
discovering some virtue.</p>

<h4>LETTER XVI</h4>

<p class="right">Paris, December 26, 1792.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I should</span> immediately on the receipt
of your letter, my dear friend, have
thanked you for your punctuality, for it
highly gratified me, had I not wished
to wait till I could tell you that this
day was not stained with blood. Indeed
the prudent precautions taken by
the National Convention to prevent a
tumult, made me suppose that the dogs
of faction would not dare to bark, much
less to bite, however true to their scent;
and I was not mistaken; for the citizens,
who were all called out, are returning
home with composed counte<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-93" id="DPg_4-93"></a>[<a href="images/v4-93.png">93</a>]</span>nances,
shouldering their arms. About
nine o'clock this morning, the king
passed by my window, moving silently
along (excepting now and then a few
strokes on the drum, which rendered
the stillness more awful) through empty
streets, surrounded by the national guards,
who, clustering round the carriage,
seemed to deserve their name. The
inhabitants flocked to their windows,
but the casements were all shut, not a
voice was heard, nor did I see any
thing like an insulting gesture.&mdash;For
the first time since I entered France,
I bowed to the majesty of the people,
and respected the propriety of behaviour
so perfectly in unison with my own
feelings. I can scarcely tell you why,
but an association of ideas made the
tears flow insensibly from my eyes,
when I saw Louis sitting, with more<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-94" id="DPg_4-94"></a>[<a href="images/v4-94.png">94</a>]</span>
dignity than I expected from his character,
in a hackney coach, going to
meet death, where so many of his race
have triumphed. My fancy instantly
brought Louis XIV before me, entering
the capital with all his pomp, after
one of the victories most flattering to
his pride, only to see the sunshine of
prosperity overshadowed by the sublime
gloom of misery. I have been alone
ever since; and, though my mind is
calm, I cannot dismiss the lively images
that have filled my imagination all the
day.&mdash;Nay, do not smile, but pity me;
for, once or twice, lifting my eyes from
the paper, I have seen eyes glare
through a glass-door opposite my chair
and bloody hands shook at me. Not
the distant sound of a footstep can I
hear.&mdash;My apartments are remote from
those of the servants, the only persons<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-95" id="DPg_4-95"></a>[<a href="images/v4-95.png">95</a>]</span>
who sleep with me in an immense hotel,
one folding door opening after another.&mdash;I
wish I had even kept the cat with
me!&mdash;I want to see something alive;
death in so many frightful shapes has
taken hold of my fancy.&mdash;I am going to
bed&mdash;and, for the first time in my life, I
cannot put out the candle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ye</span> who expect constancy where every
thing is changing, and peace in the
midst of tumult, attend to the voice of
experience, and mark in time the footsteps
of disappointment, or life will be

<p>In a sequestered valley, surrounded by
rocky mountains that intercepted many
of the passing clouds, though sunbeams
variegated their ample sides, lived a
sage, to whom nature had unlocked<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-100" id="DPg_4-100"></a>[<a href="images/v4-100.png">100</a>]</span>
her most hidden secrets. His hollow
eyes, sunk in their orbits, retired from
the view of vulgar objects, and turned
inwards, overleaped the boundary prescribed
to human knowledge. Intense
thinking during fourscore and ten years,
had whitened the scattered locks on
his head, which, like the summit of
the distant mountain, appeared to be
bound by an eternal frost.</p>

<p>On the sandy waste behind the mountains,
the track of ferocious beasts
might be traced, and sometimes the
mangled limbs which they left, attracted
a hovering flight of birds of prey. An
extensive wood the sage had forced to
rear its head in a soil by no means congenial,
and the firm trunks of the trees
seemed to frown with defiance on time;
though the spoils of innumerable summers
covered the roots, which resembled<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-101" id="DPg_4-101"></a>[<a href="images/v4-101.png">101</a>]</span>
fangs; so closely did they cling to the
unfriendly sand, where serpents hissed,
and snakes, rolling out their vast folds,
inhaled the noxious vapours. The ravens
and owls who inhabited the solitude,
gave also a thicker gloom to the
everlasting twilight, and the croaking
of the former a monotony, in unison
with the gloom; whilst lions and tygers,
shunning even this faint semblance of
day, sought the dark caverns, and at
night, when they shook off sleep, their
roaring would make the whole valley
resound, confounded with the screechings
of the bird of night.</p>

<p>One mountain rose sublime, towering
above all, on the craggy sides of which
a few sea-weeds grew, washed by the
ocean, that with tumultuous roar rushed
to assault, and even undermine, the
huge barrier that stopped its progress;<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-102" id="DPg_4-102"></a>[<a href="images/v4-102.png">102</a>]</span>
and ever and anon a ponderous mass,
loosened from the cliff, to which it
scarcely seemed to adhere, always threatening
to fall, fell into the flood, rebounding
as it fell, and the sound was re-echoed
from rock to rock. Look where
you would, all was without form, as
if nature, suddenly stopping her hand,
had left chaos a retreat.</p>

<p>Close to the most remote side of it
was the sage's abode. It was a rude
hut, formed of stumps of trees and
matted twigs, to secure him from the
inclemency of the weather; only through
small apertures crossed with rushes, the
wind entered in wild murmurs, modulated
by these obstructions. A clear
spring broke out of the middle of the
adjacent rock, which, dropping slowly
into a cavity it had hollowed, soon
overflowed, and then ran, struggling to<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-103" id="DPg_4-103"></a>[<a href="images/v4-103.png">103</a>]</span>
free itself from the cumbrous fragments,
till, become a deep, silent stream, it
escaped through reeds, and roots of
trees, whose blasted tops overhung and
darkened the current.</p>

<p>One side of the hut was supported by
the rock, and at midnight, when the
sage struck the inclosed part, it yawned
wide, and admitted him into a cavern in
the very bowels of the earth, where
never human foot before had trod; and
the various spirits, which inhabit the
different regions of nature, were here
obedient to his potent word. The cavern
had been formed by the great
inundation of waters, when the approach
of a comet forced them from
their source; then, when the fountains
of the great deep were broken up,
a stream rushed out of the centre of the
earth, where the spirits, who have lived<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-104" id="DPg_4-104"></a>[<a href="images/v4-104.png">104</a>]</span>
on it, are confined to purify themselves
from the dross contracted in their first
stage of existence; and it flowed in
black waves, for ever bubbling along
the cave, the extent of which had never
been explored. From the sides and
top, water distilled, and, petrifying as
it fell, took fantastic shapes, that soon
divided it into apartments, if so they
might be called. In the foam, a wearied
spirit would sometimes rise, to catch
the most distant glimpse of light, or
taste the vagrant breeze, which the
yawning of the rock admitted, when
Sagestus, for that was the name of the
hoary sage, entered. Some, who were
refined and almost cleared from vicious
spots, he would allow to leave, for a limited
time, their dark prison-house;
and, flying on the winds across the bleak
northern ocean, or rising in an exhala<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-105" id="DPg_4-105"></a>[<a href="images/v4-105.png">105</a>]</span>tion
till they reached a sun-beam, they
thus re-visited the haunts of men. These
were the guardian angels, who in soft
whispers restrain the vicious, and animate
the wavering wretch who stands
suspended between virtue and vice.</p>

<p>Sagestus had spent a night in the cavern,
as he often did, and he left the
silent vestibule of the grave, just as the
sun, emerging from the ocean, dispersed
the clouds, which were not half
so dense as those he had left. All that
was human in him rejoiced at the sight
of reviving life, and he viewed with
pleasure the mounting sap rising to expand
the herbs, which grew spontaneously
in this wild&mdash;when, turning his
eyes towards the sea, he found that
death had been at work during his absence,
and terrific marks of a furious
storm still spread horror around. Though<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-106" id="DPg_4-106"></a>[<a href="images/v4-106.png">106</a>]</span>
the day was serene, and threw bright
rays on eyes for ever shut, it dawned
not for the wretches who hung pendent
on the craggy rocks, or were stretched
lifeless on the sand. Some, struggling,
had dug themselves a grave; others
had resigned their breath before the
impetuous surge whirled them on shore.
A few, in whom the vital spark was
not so soon dislodged, had clung to
loose fragments; it was the grasp of
death; embracing the stone, they stiffened;
and the head, no longer erect,
rested on the mass which the arms encircled.
It felt not the agonizing gripe,
nor heard the sigh that broke the heart
in twain.</p>

<p>Resting his chin on an oaken club,
the sage looked on every side, to see
if he could discern any who yet breathed.
He drew nearer, and thought he<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-107" id="DPg_4-107"></a>[<a href="images/v4-107.png">107</a>]</span>
saw, at the first glance, the unclosed eyes
glare; but soon perceived that they
were a mere glassy substance, mute as
the tongue; the jaws were fallen, and,
in some of the tangled locks, hands
were clinched; nay, even the nails
had entered sharpened by despair. The
blood flew rapidly to his heart; it was
flesh; he felt he was still a man, and
the big tear paced down his iron cheeks,
whose muscles had not for a long time
been relaxed by such humane emotions.
A moment he breathed quick, then
heaved a sigh, and his wonted calm
returned with an unaccustomed glow
of tenderness; for the ways of heaven
were not hid from him; he lifted up
his eyes to the common Father of nature,
and all was as still in his bosom, as
the smooth deep, after having closed<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-108" id="DPg_4-108"></a>[<a href="images/v4-108.png">108</a>]</span>
over the huge vessel from which the
wretches had fled.</p>

<p>Turning round a part of the rock
that jutted out, meditating on the ways
of Providence, a weak infantine voice
reached his ears; it was lisping out the
name of mother. He looked, and beheld
a blooming child leaning over, and
kissing with eager fondness, lips that
were insensible to the warm pressure.
Starting at the sight of the sage, she
fixed her eyes on him, "Wake her,
ah! wake her," she cried, "or the
sea will catch us." Again he felt compassion,
for he saw that the mother
slept the sleep of death. He stretched
out his hand, and, smoothing his brow,
invited her to approach; but she still
intreated him to wake her mother,
whom she continued to call, with an
impatient tremulous voice. To detach<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-109" id="DPg_4-109"></a>[<a href="images/v4-109.png">109</a>]</span>
her from the body by persuasion would
not have been very easy. Sagestus had
a quicker method to effect his purpose;
he took out a box which contained a
soporific powder, and as soon as the
fumes reached her brain, the powers of
life were suspended.</p>

<p>He carried her directly to his hut,
and left her sleeping profoundly on his
rushy couch.</p>

<hr class="full" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-110" id="DPg_4-110"></a>[<a href="images/v4-110.png">110</a>]</span></p>
<h2><a name="DV4_CHAP_II" id="DV4_CHAP_II"></a>CHAP. II.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Again</span> Sagestus approached the
dead, to view them with a more scrutinizing
eye. He was perfectly acquainted
with the construction of the
human body, knew the traces that virtue
or vice leaves on the whole frame;
they were now indelibly fixed by death;
nay more, he knew by the shape of
the solid structure, how far the spirit
could range, and saw the barrier beyond
which it could not pass: the mazes of
fancy he explored, measured the stretch
of thought, and, weighing all in an
even balance, could tell whom nature
had stamped an hero, a poet, or philosopher.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-111" id="DPg_4-111"></a>[<a href="images/v4-111.png">111</a>]</span>
By their appearance, at a transient
glance, he knew that the vessel must
have contained many passengers, and
that some of them were above the vulgar,
with respect to fortune and education;
he then walked leisurely among
the dead, and narrowly observed their
pallid features.</p>

<p>His eye first rested on a form in which
proportion reigned, and, stroking back
the hair, a spacious forehead met his
view; warm fancy had revelled there,
and her airy dance had left vestiges,
scarcely visible to a mortal eye. Some
perpendicular lines pointed out that
melancholy had predominated in his
constitution; yet the straggling hairs
of his eye-brows showed that anger had
often shook his frame; indeed, the
four temperatures, like the four elements,
had resided in this little world,<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-112" id="DPg_4-112"></a>[<a href="images/v4-112.png">112</a>]</span>
and produced harmony. The whole
visage was bony, and an energetic
frown had knit the flexible skin of his
brow; the kingdom within had been
extensive; and the wild creations of
fancy had there "a local habitation
and a name." So exquisite was his
sensibility, so quick his comprehension,
that he perceived various combinations
in an instant; he caught truth as she
darted towards him, saw all her fair
proportion at a glance, and the flash of
his eye spoke the quick senses which
conveyed intelligence to his mind; the
sensorium indeed was capacious, and
the sage imagined he saw the lucid
beam, sparkling with love or ambition,
in characters of fire, which a graceful
curve of the upper eyelid shaded. The
lips were a little deranged by contempt;
and a mixture of vanity and<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-113" id="DPg_4-113"></a>[<a href="images/v4-113.png">113</a>]</span>
self-complacency formed a few irregular
lines round them. The chin had
suffered from sensuality, yet there were
still great marks of vigour in it, as if
advanced with stern dignity. The
hand accustomed to command, and even
tyrannize, was unnerved; but its appearance
convinced Sagestus, that he
had oftener wielded a thought than a
weapon; and that he had silenced, by
irresistible conviction, the superficial
disputant, and the being, who doubted
because he had not strength to believe,
who, wavering between different borrowed
opinions, first caught at one
straw, then at another, unable to settle
into any consistency of character. After
gazing a few moments, Sagestus turned
away exclaiming, How are the stately
oaks torn up by a tempest, and the bow<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-114" id="DPg_4-114"></a>[<a href="images/v4-114.png">114</a>]</span>
unstrung, that could force the arrow
beyond the ken of the eye!</p>

<p>What a different face next met his
view! The forehead was short, yet well
set together; the nose small, but a little
turned up at the end; and a draw-down
at the sides of his mouth, proved that
he had been a humourist, who minded
the main chance, and could joke with
his acquaintance, while he eagerly devoured
a dainty which he was not to
pay for. His lips shut like a box whose
hinges had often been mended; and
the muscles, which display the soft emotion
of the heart on the cheeks, were
grown quite rigid, so that, the vessels
that should have moistened them not
having much communication with the
grand source of passions, the fine volatile
fluid had evaporated, and they
became mere dry fibres, which might<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-115" id="DPg_4-115"></a>[<a href="images/v4-115.png">115</a>]</span>
be pulled by any misfortune that
threatened himself, but were not sufficiently
elastic to be moved by the
miseries of others. His joints were
inserted compactly, and with celerity
they had performed all the animal
functions, without any of the grace
which results from the imagination
mixing with the senses.</p>

<p>A huge form was stretched near him,
that exhibited marks of overgrown
infancy; every part was relaxed; all
appeared imperfect. Yet, some undulating
lines on the puffed-out cheeks,
displayed signs of timid, servile good
nature; and the skin of the forehead
had been so often drawn up by wonder,
that the few hairs of the eyebrows were
fixed in a sharp arch, whilst an ample
chin rested in lobes of flesh on his protuberant
breast.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-116" id="DPg_4-116"></a>[<a href="images/v4-116.png">116</a>]</span>
By his side was a body that had
scarcely ever much life in it&mdash;sympathy
seemed to have drawn them together&mdash;every
feature and limb was round and
fleshy, and, if a kind of brutal cunning
had not marked the face, it might have
been mistaken for an automaton, so unmixed
was the phlegmatic fluid. The
vital spark was buried deep in a soft
mass of matter, resembling the pith in
young elder, which, when found, is so
equivocal, that it only appears a moister
part of the same body.</p>

<p>Another part of the beach was
covered with sailors, whose bodies exhibited
marks of strength and brutal
courage.&mdash;Their characters were all
different, though of the same class;
Sagestus did not stay to discriminate
them, satisfied with a rough sketch.
He saw indolence roused by a love of<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-117" id="DPg_4-117"></a>[<a href="images/v4-117.png">117</a>]</span>
humour, or rather bodily fun; sensuality
and prodigality with a vein of generosity
running through it; a contempt
of danger with gross superstition;
supine senses, only to be kept alive by
noisy, tumultuous pleasures, or that
kind of novelty which borders on absurdity:
this formed the common outline,
and the rest were rather dabs than
shades.</p>

<p>Sagestus paused, and remembered it
had been said by an earthly wit, that
"many a flower is born to blush unseen,
and waste its sweetness on the
desart air." How little, he exclaimed,
did that poet know of the ways of
heaven! And yet, in this respect, they
are direct; the hands before me, were
designed to pull a rope, knock down a
sheep, or perform the servile offices of
life; no "mute, inglorious poet" rests<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-118" id="DPg_4-118"></a>[<a href="images/v4-118.png">118</a>]</span>
amongst them, and he who is superior
to his fellow, does not rise above mediocrity.
The genius that sprouts from
a dunghil soon shakes off the heterogenous
mass; those only grovel, who
have not power to fly.</p>

<p>He turned his step towards the mother
of the orphan: another female
was at some distance; and a man who,
by his garb, might have been the husband,
or brother, of the former, was
not far off.</p>

<p>Him the sage surveyed with an attentive
eye, and bowed with respect
to the inanimate clay, that lately had
been the dwelling of a most benevolent
spirit. The head was square, though
the features were not very prominent;
but there was a great harmony in every
part, and the turn of the nostrils and
lips evinced, that the soul must have<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-119" id="DPg_4-119"></a>[<a href="images/v4-119.png">119</a>]</span>
had taste, to which they had served as
organs. Penetration and judgment
were seated on the brows that overhung
the eye. Fixed as it was, Sagestus
quickly discerned the expression
it must have had; dark and pensive,
rather from slowness of comprehension
than melancholy, it seemed to absorb
the light of knowledge, to drink it in
ray by ray; nay, a new one was not
allowed to enter his head till the last
was arranged: an opinion was thus
cautiously received, and maturely
weighed, before it was added to the
general stock. As nature led him to
mount from a part to the whole, he
was most conversant with the beautiful,
and rarely comprehended the sublime;
yet, said Sagestus, with a softened tone,
he was all heart, full of forbearance, and
desirous to please every fellow-creature;<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-120" id="DPg_4-120"></a>[<a href="images/v4-120.png">120</a>]</span>
but from a nobler motive than a love
of admiration; the fumes of vanity
never mounted to cloud his brain, or
tarnish his beneficence. The fluid in
which those placid eyes swam, is now
congealed; how often has tenderness
given them the finest water! Some
torn parts of the child's dress hung
round his arm, which led the sage to
conclude, that he had saved the child;
every line in his face confirmed the
conjecture; benevolence indeed strung
the nerves that naturally were not
very firm; it was the great knot that
tied together the scattered qualities,
and gave the distinct stamp to the character.</p>

<p>The female whom he next approached,
and supposed to be an attendant on
the other, was below the middle size,
and her legs were so disproportionably<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-121" id="DPg_4-121"></a>[<a href="images/v4-121.png">121</a>]</span>
short, that, when she moved, she must
have waddled along; her elbows were
drawn in to touch her long taper, waist,
and the air of her whole body was an
affectation of gentility. Death could
not alter the rigid hang of her limbs, or
efface the simper that had stretched her
mouth; the lips were thin, as if nature
intended she should mince her words;
her nose was small, and sharp at the
end; and the forehead, unmarked by
eyebrows, was wrinkled by the discontent
that had sunk her cheeks, on
which Sagestus still discerned faint
traces of tenderness; and fierce good-nature,
he perceived had sometimes
animated the little spark of an eye that
anger had oftener lighted. The same
thought occurred to him that the sight
of the sailors had suggested, Men and
women are all in their proper places<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-122" id="DPg_4-122"></a>[<a href="images/v4-122.png">122</a>]</span>&mdash;this
female was intended to fold up
linen and nurse the sick.</p>

<p>Anxious to observe the mother of
his charge, he turned to the lily that
had been so rudely snapped, and, carefully
observing it, traced every fine line
to its source. There was a delicacy in
her form, so truly feminine, that an involuntary
desire to cherish such a being,
made the sage again feel the almost forgotten
sensations of his nature. On
observing her more closely, he discovered
that her natural delicacy had been
increased by an improper education,
to a degree that took away all vigour
from her faculties. And its baneful
influence had had such an effect on her
mind, that few traces of the exertions
of it appeared on her face, though the
fine finish of her features, and particularly
the form of the forehead, con<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-123" id="DPg_4-123"></a>[<a href="images/v4-123.png">123</a>]</span>vinced
the sage that her understanding
might have risen considerably above
mediocrity, had the wheels ever been
put in motion; but, clogged by prejudices,
they never turned quite round,
and, whenever she considered a subject,
she stopped before she came to a conclusion.
Assuming a mask of propriety,
she had banished nature; yet
its tendency was only to be diverted,
not stifled. Some lines, which took
from the symmetry of the mouth, not
very obvious to a superficial observer,
struck Sagestus, and they appeared to
him characters of indolent obstinacy.
Not having courage to form an opinion
of her own, she adhered, with blind
partiality, to those she adopted, which
she received in the lump, and, as they
always remained unopened, of course
she only saw the even gloss on the out<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-124" id="DPg_4-124"></a>[<a href="images/v4-124.png">124</a>]</span>side.
Vestiges of anger were visible on
her brow, and the sage concluded, that
she had often been offended with, and
indeed would scarcely make any allowance
for, those who did not coincide
with her in opinion, as things always
appear self-evident that have never
been examined; yet her very weakness
gave a charming timidity to her countenance;
goodness and tenderness pervaded
every lineament, and melted in
her dark blue eyes. The compassion
that wanted activity, was sincere, though
it only embellished her face, or produced
casual acts of charity when a
moderate alms could relieve present
distress. Unacquainted with life, fictitious,
unnatural distress drew the tears
that were not shed for real misery. In
its own shape, human wretchedness
excites a little disgust in the mind that<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-125" id="DPg_4-125"></a>[<a href="images/v4-125.png">125</a>]</span>
has indulged sickly refinement. Perhaps
the sage gave way to a little conjecture
in drawing the last conclusion;
but his conjectures generally arose from
distinct ideas, and a dawn of light
allowed him to see a great way farther
than common mortals.</p>

<p>He was now convinced that the orphan
was not very unfortunate in having
lost such a mother. The parent that
inspires fond affection without respect,
is seldom an useful one; and they only
are respectable, who consider right and
wrong abstracted from local forms and
accidental modifications.</p>

<p>Determined to adopt the child, he
named it after himself, Sagesta, and
retired to the hut where the innocent
slept, to think of the best method of
educating this child, whom the angry
deep had spared.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-126" id="DPg_4-126"></a>[<a href="images/v4-126.png">126</a>]</span>
[The last branch of the education of
Sagesta, consisted of a variety of characters
and stories presented to her
in the Cave of Fancy, of which the
following is a specimen.]</p>

<hr class="full" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-127" id="DPg_4-127"></a>[<a href="images/v4-127.png">127</a>]</span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAP" id="DCHAP"></a>CHAP.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A form</span> now approached that
particularly struck and interested Sagesta.
The sage, observing what passed in her
mind, bade her ever trust to the first
impression. In life, he continued, try
to remember the effect the first appearance
of a stranger has on your mind;
and, in proportion to your sensibility,
you may decide on the character. Intelligence
glances from eyes that have
the same pursuits, and a benevolent
heart soon traces the marks of benevolence
on the countenance of an unknown
fellow-creature; and not only
the countenance, but the gestures, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-128" id="DPg_4-128"></a>[<a href="images/v4-128.png">128</a>]</span>
voice, loudly speak truth to the unprejudiced
mind.</p>

<p>Whenever a stranger advances towards
you with a tripping step, receives
you with broad smiles, and a profusion
of compliments, and yet you find yourself
embarrassed and unable to return
the salutation with equal cordiality, be
assured that such a person is affected,
and endeavours to maintain a very good
character in the eyes of the world,
without really practising the social virtues
which dress the face in looks of
unfeigned complacency. Kindred minds
are drawn to each other by expressions
which elude description; and, like the
calm breeze that plays on a smooth
lake, they are rather felt than seen.
Beware of a man who always appears in
good humour; a selfish design too frequently
lurks in the smiles the heart<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-129" id="DPg_4-129"></a>[<a href="images/v4-129.png">129</a>]</span>
never curved; or there is an affectation
of candour that destroys all strength of
character, by blending truth and falshood
into an unmeaning mass. The
mouth, in fact, seems to be the feature
where you may trace every kind of dissimulation,
from the simper of vanity,
to the fixed smile of the designing villain.
Perhaps, the modulations of
the voice will still more quickly give
a key to the character than even the
turns of the mouth, or the words
that issue from it; often do the
tones of unpractised dissemblers give
the lie to their assertions. Many
people never speak in an unnatural
voice, but when they are insincere: the
phrases not corresponding with the
dictates of the heart, have nothing to
keep them in tune. In the course of
an argument however, you may easily
discover whether vanity or conviction<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-130" id="DPg_4-130"></a>[<a href="images/v4-130.png">130</a>]</span>
stimulates the disputant, though his
inflated countenance may be turned
from you, and you may not see the
gestures which mark self-sufficiency.
He stopped, and the spirit began.</p>

<p>I have wandered through the cave;
and, as soon as I have taught you a useful
lesson, I shall take my flight where
my tears will cease to flow, and where
mine eyes will no more be shocked
with the sight of guilt and sorrow.
Before many moons have changed,
thou wilt enter, O mortal! into that
world I have lately left. Listen to my
warning voice, and trust not too much
to the goodness which I perceive resides
in thy breast. Let it be reined in by
principles, lest thy very virtue sharpen
the sting of remorse, which as naturally
follows disorder in the moral world, as
pain attends on intemperance in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-131" id="DPg_4-131"></a>[<a href="images/v4-131.png">131</a>]</span>
physical. But my history will afford you
more instruction than mere advice. Sagestus
concurred in opinion with her,
observing that the senses of children
should be the first object of improvement;
then their passions worked on; and judgment
the fruit, must be the acquirement
of the being itself, when out of
leading-strings. The spirit bowed assent,
and, without any further prelude,
entered on her history.</p>

<p>My mother was a most respectable
character, but she was yoked to a man
whose follies and vices made her ever
feel the weight of her chains. The
first sensation I recollect, was pity; for
I have seen her weep over me and the
rest of her babes, lamenting that the
extravagance of a father would throw
us destitute on the world. But, though
my father was extravagant, and seldom<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-132" id="DPg_4-132"></a>[<a href="images/v4-132.png">132</a>]</span>
thought of any thing but his own pleasures,
our education was not neglected.
In solitude, this employment was my
mother's only solace; and my father's
pride made him procure us masters;
nay, sometimes he was so gratified by
our improvement, that he would embrace
us with tenderness, and intreat
my mother to forgive him, with marks
of real contrition. But the affection his
penitence gave rise to, only served to
expose her to continual disappointments,
and keep hope alive merely to
torment her. After a violent debauch
he would let his beard grow, and the
sadness that reigned in the house I shall
never forget; he was ashamed to meet
even the eyes of his children. This is so
contrary to the nature of things, it
gave me exquisite pain; I used, at those
times, to show him extreme respect. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-133" id="DPg_4-133"></a>[<a href="images/v4-133.png">133</a>]</span>
could not bear to see my parent humble
himself before me. However neither
his constitution, nor fortune could
long bear the constant waste. He had,
I have observed, a childish affection
for his children, which was displayed
in caresses that gratified him for the
moment, yet never restrained the headlong
fury of his appetites; his momentary
repentance wrung his heart, without
influencing his conduct; and he died,
leaving an encumbered wreck of a good
estate.</p>

<p>As we had always lived in splendid
poverty, rather than in affluence, the
shock was not so great; and my mother
repressed her anguish, and concealed
some circumstances, that she might not
shed a destructive mildew over the
gaiety of youth.</p>

<p>So fondly did I doat on this dear pa<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-134" id="DPg_4-134"></a>[<a href="images/v4-134.png">134</a>]</span>rent,
that she engrossed all my tenderness;
her sorrows had knit me firmly to
her, and my chief care was to give her
proofs of affection. The gallantry that
afforded my companions, the few young
people my mother forced me to mix
with, so much pleasure, I despised; I
wished more to be loved than admired,
for I could love. I adored virtue; and
my imagination, chasing a chimerical
object, overlooked the common pleasures
of life; they were not sufficient for my
happiness. A latent fire made me burn
to rise superior to my contemporaries in
wisdom and virtue; and tears of joy
and emulation filled my eyes when I
read an account of a great action&mdash;I
felt admiration, not astonishment.</p>

<p>My mother had two particular friends,
who endeavoured to settle her affairs;
one was a middle-aged man, a mer<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-135" id="DPg_4-135"></a>[<a href="images/v4-135.png">135</a>]</span>chant;
the human breast never enshrined
a more benevolent heart. His
manners were rather rough, and he
bluntly spoke his thoughts without observing
the pain it gave; yet he possessed
extreme tenderness, as far as his discernment
went. Men do not make
sufficient distinction, said she, digressing
from her story to address Sagestus, between
tenderness and sensibility.</p>

<p>To give the shortest definition of sensibility,
replied the sage, I should say
that it is the result of acute senses, finely
fashioned nerves, which vibrate at the
slightest touch, and convey such clear intelligence
to the brain, that it does not
require to be arranged by the judgment.
Such persons instantly enter into the
characters of others, and instinctively
discern what will give pain to every
human being; their own feelings are<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-136" id="DPg_4-136"></a>[<a href="images/v4-136.png">136</a>]</span>
so varied that they seem to contain in
themselves, not only all the passions of the
species, but their various modifications.
Exquisite pain and pleasure is their
portion; nature wears for them a different
aspect than is displayed to common
mortals. One moment it is a paradise;
all is beautiful: a cloud arises, an emotion
receives a sudden damp; darkness
invades the sky, and the world is an
unweeded garden;&mdash;but go on with
your narrative, said Sagestus, recollecting
himself.</p>

<p>She proceeded. The man I am describing
was humanity itself; but frequently
he did not understand me; many of my
feelings were not to be analyzed by
his common sense. His friendships,
for he had many friends, gave him pleasure
unmixed with pain; his religion
was coldly reasonable, because he want<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-137" id="DPg_4-137"></a>[<a href="images/v4-137.png">137</a>]</span>ed
fancy, and he did not feel the necessity
of finding, or creating, a perfect
object, to answer the one engraved on
his heart: the sketch there was faint.
He went with the stream, and rather
caught a character from the society he
lived in, than spread one around him.
In my mind many opinions were graven
with a pen of brass, which he thought
chimerical: but time could not erase
them, and I now recognize them as
the seeds of eternal happiness: they
will soon expand in those realms where
I shall enjoy the bliss adapted to my
nature; this is all we need ask of the
Supreme Being; happiness must follow
the completion of his designs. He
however could live quietly, without
giving a preponderancy to many important
opinions that continually obtruded
on my mind; not having an en<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-138" id="DPg_4-138"></a>[<a href="images/v4-138.png">138</a>]</span>thusiastic
affection for his fellow creatures,
he did them good, without suffering
from their follies. He was particularly
attached to me, and I felt for
him all the affection of a daughter;
often, when he had been interesting
himself to promote my welfare, have I
lamented that he was not my father;
lamented that the vices of mine had
dried up one source of pure affection.</p>

<p>The other friend I have already alluded
to, was of a very different character;
greatness of mind, and those
combinations of feeling which are so
difficult to describe, raised him above
the throng, that bustle their hour out,
lie down to sleep, and are forgotten.
But I shall soon see him, she exclaimed,
as much superior to his former self, as
he then rose in my eyes above his fellow
creatures! As she spoke, a glow<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-139" id="DPg_4-139"></a>[<a href="images/v4-139.png">139</a>]</span>
of delight animated each feature; her
countenance appeared transparent; and
she silently anticipated the happiness
she should enjoy, when she entered those
mansions, where death-divided friends
should meet, to part no more; where
human weakness could not damp their
bliss, or poison the cup of joy that, on
earth, drops from the lips as soon as
tasted, or, if some daring mortal snatches
a hasty draught, what was sweet to the
taste becomes a root of bitterness.</p>

<p>He was unfortunate, had many cares
to struggle with, and I marked on his
cheeks traces of the same sorrows that
sunk my own. He was unhappy I say,
and perhaps pity might first have awoke
my tenderness; for, early in life, an
artful woman worked on his compassionate
soul, and he united his fate to
a being made up of such jarring ele<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-140" id="DPg_4-140"></a>[<a href="images/v4-140.png">140</a>]</span>ments,
that he was still alone. The
discovery did not extinguish that propensity
to love, a high sense of virtue
fed. I saw him sick and unhappy,
without a friend to sooth the hours
languor made heavy; often did I sit a
long winter's evening by his side, railing
at the swift wings of time, and
terming my love, humanity.</p>

<p>Two years passed in this manner, silently
rooting my affection; and it might
have continued calm, if a fever had
not brought him to the very verge of
the grave. Though still deceived, I was
miserable that the customs of the world
did not allow me to watch by him;
when sleep forsook his pillow, my wearied
eyes were not closed, and my
anxious spirit hovered round his bed.
I saw him, before he had recovered his
strength; and, when his hand touched<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-141" id="DPg_4-141"></a>[<a href="images/v4-141.png">141</a>]</span>
mine, life almost retired, or flew to
meet the touch. The first look found
a ready way to my heart, and thrilled
through every vein. We were left
alone, and insensibly began to talk of
the immortality of the soul; I declared
that I could not live without this conviction.
In the ardour of conversation
he pressed my hand to his heart; it
rested there a moment, and my emotions
gave weight to my opinion, for
the affection we felt was not of a perishable
nature.&mdash;A silence ensued, I
know not how long; he then threw
my hand from him, as if it had been a
serpent; formally complained of the
weather, and adverted to twenty other
uninteresting subjects. Vain efforts!
Our hearts had already spoken to
each other.</p>

<p>Feebly did I afterwards combat an<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-142" id="DPg_4-142"></a>[<a href="images/v4-142.png">142</a>]</span>
affection, which seemed twisted in every
fibre of my heart. The world stood still
when I thought of him; it moved heavily
at best, with one whose very constitution
seemed to mark her out for misery.
But I will not dwell on the passion
I too fondly nursed. One only refuge
had I on earth; I could not resolutely
desolate the scene my fancy flew to,
when worldly cares, when a knowledge
of mankind, which my circumstances
forced on me, rendered every other
insipid. I was afraid of the unmarked
vacuity of common life; yet, though I
supinely indulged myself in fairy-land,
when I ought to have been more actively
employed, virtue was still the
first mover of my actions; she dressed
my love in such enchanting colours,
and spread the net I could never break.
Our corresponding feelings confounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-143" id="DPg_4-143"></a>[<a href="images/v4-143.png">143</a>]</span>
our very souls; and in many conversations
we almost intuitively discerned
each other's sentiments; the heart opened
itself, not chilled by reserve, nor
afraid of misconstruction. But, if virtue
inspired love, love gave new energy to
virtue, and absorbed every selfish passion.
Never did even a wish escape
me, that my lover should not fulfil the
hard duties which fate had imposed on
him. I only dissembled with him in
one particular; I endeavoured to soften
his wife's too conspicuous follies, and
extenuated her failings in an indirect
manner. To this I was prompted by a
loftiness of spirit; I should have broken
the band of life, had I ceased to respect
myself. But I will hasten to an important
change in my circumstances.</p>

<p>My mother, who had concealed the
real state of her affairs from me, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-144" id="DPg_4-144"></a>[<a href="images/v4-144.png">144</a>]</span>
now impelled to make me her confident,
that I might assist to discharge
her mighty debt of gratitude. The
merchant, my more than father, had
privately assisted her: but a fatal civil-war
reduced his large property to a
bare competency; and an inflammation
in his eyes, that arose from a cold he
had caught at a wreck, which he watched
during a stormy night to keep off
the lawless colliers, almost deprived
him of sight. His life had been spent
in society, and he scarcely knew how
to fill the void; for his spirit would not
allow him to mix with his former
equals as an humble companion; he
who had been treated with uncommon
respect, could not brook their insulting
pity. From the resource of solitude,
reading, the complaint in his eyes cut<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-145" id="DPg_4-145"></a>[<a href="images/v4-145.png">145</a>]</span>
him off, and he became our constant
visitor.</p>

<p>Actuated by the sincerest affection,
I used to read to him, and he mistook
my tenderness for love. How could I
undeceive him, when every circumstance
frowned on him! Too soon I
found that I was his only comfort; I,
who rejected his hand when fortune
smiled, could not now second her blow;
and, in a moment of enthusiastic gratitude
and tender compassion, I offered
him my hand.&mdash;It was received with
pleasure; transport was not made for
his soul; nor did he discover that nature
had separated us, by making me
alive to such different sensations. My
mother was to live with us, and I
dwelt on this circumstance to banish
cruel recollections, when the bent bow
returned to its former state.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-146" id="DPg_4-146"></a>[<a href="images/v4-146.png">146</a>]</span>
With a bursting heart and a firm
voice, I named the day when I was to
seal my promise. It came, in spite of
my regret; I had been previously preparing
myself for the awful ceremony,
and answered the solemn question with
a resolute tone, that would silence the
dictates of my heart; it was a forced,
unvaried one; had nature modulated
it, my secret would have escaped. My
active spirit was painfully on the watch
to repress every tender emotion. The
joy in my venerable parent's countenance,
the tenderness of my husband,
as he conducted me home, for I really
had a sincere affection for him, the gratulations
of my mind, when I thought
that this sacrifice was heroic, all tended
to deceive me; but the joy of victory
over the resigned, pallid look of my
lover, haunted my imagination, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-147" id="DPg_4-147"></a>[<a href="images/v4-147.png">147</a>]</span>
fixed itself in the centre of my brain.&mdash;Still
I imagined, that his spirit was near
me, that he only felt sorrow for my
loss, and without complaint resigned
me to my duty.</p>

<p>I was left alone a moment; my two
elbows rested on a table to support my
chin. Ten thousand thoughts darted
with astonishing velocity through my
mind. My eyes were dry; I was on the
brink of madness. At this moment a
strange association was made by my
imagination; I thought of Gallileo, who
when he left the inquisition, looked
upwards, and cried out, "Yet it moves."
A shower of tears, like the refreshing
drops of heaven, relieved my parched
sockets; they fell disregarded on the
table; and, stamping with my foot, in an
agony I exclaimed, "Yet I love." My
husband entered before I had calmed<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-148" id="DPg_4-148"></a>[<a href="images/v4-148.png">148</a>]</span>
these tumultuous emotions, and tenderly
took my hand. I snatched it from
him; grief and surprise were marked
on his countenance; I hastily stretched
it out again. My heart smote me, and I
removed the transient mist by an unfeigned
endeavour to please him.</p>

<p>A few months after, my mind grew
calmer; and, if a treacherous imagination,
if feelings many accidents revived,
sometimes plunged me into melancholy,
I often repeated with steady
conviction, that virtue was not an
empty name, and that, in following the
dictates of duty, I had not bidden adieu
to content.</p>

<p>In the course of a few years, the
dear object of my fondest affection,
said farewel, in dying accents. Thus
left alone, my grief became dear; and I
did not feel solitary, because I thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-149" id="DPg_4-149"></a>[<a href="images/v4-149.png">149</a>]</span>
I might, without a crime, indulge a
passion, that grew more ardent than ever
when my imagination only presented
him to my view, and restored my former
activity of soul which the late
calm had rendered torpid. I seemed to
find myself again, to find the eccentric
warmth that gave me identity of character.
Reason had governed my conduct,
but could not change my nature;
this voluptuous sorrow was superior to
every gratification of sense, and death
more firmly united our hearts.</p>

<p>Alive to every human affection, I
smoothed my mothers passage to eternity,
and so often gave my husband
sincere proofs of affection, he never
supposed that I was actuated by a more
fervent attachment. My melancholy,
my uneven spirits, he attributed to my
extreme sensibility, and loved me the<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-150" id="DPg_4-150"></a>[<a href="images/v4-150.png">150</a>]</span>
better for possessing qualities he could
not comprehend.</p>

<p>At the close of a summer's day, some
years after, I wandered with careless
steps over a pathless common; various
anxieties had rendered the hours which
the sun had enlightened heavy; sober
evening came on; I wished to still "my
mind, and woo lone quiet in her silent
walk." The scene accorded with my
feelings; it was wild and grand; and
the spreading twilight had almost confounded
the distant sea with the barren,
blue hills that melted from my sight.
I sat down on a rising ground; the rays
of the departing sun illumined the horizon,
but so indistinctly, that I anticipated
their total extinction. The
death of Nature led me to a still more
interesting subject, that came home to
my bosom, the death of him I loved.<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-151" id="DPg_4-151"></a>[<a href="images/v4-151.png">151</a>]</span>
A village-bell was tolling; I listened,
and thought of the moment when I
heard his interrupted breath, and felt
the agonizing fear, that the same sound
would never more reach my ears, and
that the intelligence glanced from my
eyes, would no more be felt. The
spoiler had seized his prey; the sun
was fled, what was this world to me!
I wandered to another, where death
and darkness could not enter; I pursued
the sun beyond the mountains,
and the soul escaped from this vale of
tears. My reflections were tinged with
melancholy, but they were sublime.&mdash;I
grasped a mighty whole, and smiled
on the king of terrors; the tie which
bound me to my friends he could not
break; the same mysterious knot united
me to the source of all goodness and
happiness. I had seen the divinity re<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-152" id="DPg_4-152"></a>[<a href="images/v4-152.png">152</a>]</span>flected
in a face I loved; I had read
immortal characters displayed on a
human countenance, and forgot myself
whilst I gazed. I could not think of
immortality, without recollecting the
ecstacy I felt, when my heart first whispered
to me that I was beloved; and
again did I feel the sacred tie of mutual
affection; fervently I prayed to the father
of mercies; and rejoiced that he
could see every turn of a heart, whose
movements I could not perfectly understand.
My passion seemed a pledge
of immortality; I did not wish to hide
it from the all-searching eye of heaven.
Where indeed could I go from his presence?
and, whilst it was dear to me,
though darkness might reign during
the night of life, joy would come when
I awoke to life everlasting.</p>

<p>I now turned my step towards home,<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-153" id="DPg_4-153"></a>[<a href="images/v4-153.png">153</a>]</span>
when the appearance of a girl, who
stood weeping on the common, attracted
my attention. I accosted her,
and soon heard her simple tale; that her
father was gone to sea, and her mother
sick in bed. I followed her to their
little dwelling, and relieved the sick
wretch. I then again sought my own
abode; but death did not now haunt
my fancy. Contriving to give the poor
creature I had left more effectual relief,
I reached my own garden-gate very
weary, and rested on it.&mdash;Recollecting
the turns of my mind during the walk,
I exclaimed, Surely life may thus be
enlivened by active benevolence, and
the sleep of death, like that I am now
disposed to fall into, may be sweet!</p>

<p>My life was now unmarked by any
extraordinary change, and a few days<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-154" id="DPg_4-154"></a>[<a href="images/v4-154.png">154</a>]</span>
ago I entered this cavern; for through
it every mortal must pass; and here I
have discovered, that I neglected many
opportunities of being useful, whilst I
fostered a devouring flame. Remorse
has not reached me, because I firmly
adhered to my principles, and I have
also discovered that I saw through a
false medium. Worthy as the mortal
was I adored, I should not long have
loved him with the ardour I did, had
fate united us, and broken the delusion
the imagination so artfully wove. His
virtues, as they now do, would have
extorted my esteem; but he who formed
the human soul, only can fill it, and the
chief happiness of an immortal being
must arise from the same source as its
existence. Earthly love leads to heavenly,
and prepares us for a more ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-155" id="DPg_4-155"></a>[<a href="images/v4-155.png">155</a>]</span>alted
state; if it does not change its
nature, and destroy itself, by trampling
on the virtue, that constitutes its essence,
and allies us to the Deity.</p>

<h3>ON</h3>

<h2>POETRY, &amp;c.</h2>
<hr class="short" />
<p><span class="smcap">A taste</span> for rural scenes, in the
present state of society, appears to be
very often an artificial sentiment, rather
inspired by poetry and romances,
than a real perception of the beauties
of nature. But, as it is reckoned a
proof of refined taste to praise the calm
pleasures which the country affords, the
theme is never exhausted. Yet it may
be made a question, whether this ro<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-160" id="DPg_4-160"></a>[<a href="images/v4-160.png">160</a>]</span>mantic
kind of declamation, has much
effect on the conduct of those, who
leave, for a season, the crowded cities
in which they were bred.</p>

<p>I have been led to these reflections,
by observing, when I have resided for
any length of time in the country, how
few people seem to contemplate nature
with their own eyes. I have "brushed
the dew away" in the morning; but,
pacing over the printless grass, I have
wondered that, in such delightful situations,
the sun was allowed to rise in
solitary majesty, whilst my eyes alone
hailed its beautifying beams. The
webs of the evening have still been
spread across the hedged path, unless
some labouring man, trudging to work,
disturbed the fairy structure; yet, in
spite of this supineness, when I joined<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-161" id="DPg_4-161"></a>[<a href="images/v4-161.png">161</a>]</span>
the social circle, every tongue rang
changes on the pleasures of the country.</p>

<p>Having frequently had occasion to
make the same observation, I was led to
endeavour, in one of my solitary rambles,
to trace the cause, and likewise
to enquire why the poetry written in
the infancy of society, is most natural:
which, strictly speaking (for <i>natural</i>
is a very indefinite expression) is merely
to say, that it is the transcript of immediate
sensations, in all their native
wildness and simplicity, when fancy,
awakened by the sight of interesting
objects, was most actively at work.
At such moments, sensibility quickly
furnishes similes, and the sublimated
spirits combine images, which rising
spontaneously, it is not necessary coldly
to ransack the understanding or memory,
till the laborious efforts of judg<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-162" id="DPg_4-162"></a>[<a href="images/v4-162.png">162</a>]</span>ment
exclude present sensations, and
damp the fire of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The effusions of a vigorous mind, will
ever tell us how far the understanding
has been enlarged by thought, and
stored with knowledge. The richness
of the soil even appears on the surface;
and the result of profound thinking,
often mixing, with playful grace, in the
reveries of the poet, smoothly incorporates
with the ebullitions of animal
spirits, when the finely fashioned nerve
vibrates acutely with rapture, or when,
relaxed by soft melancholy, a pleasing
languor prompts the long-drawn sigh,
and feeds the slowly falling tear.</p>

<p>The poet, the man of strong feelings,
gives us only an image of his mind,
when he was actually alone, conversing
with himself, and marking the impression
which nature had made on his<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-163" id="DPg_4-163"></a>[<a href="images/v4-163.png">163</a>]</span>
own heart.&mdash;If, at this sacred moment,
the idea of some departed friend, some
tender recollection when the soul was
most alive to tenderness, intruded unawares
into his thoughts, the sorrow
which it produced is artlessly, yet poetically
expressed&mdash;and who can avoid
sympathizing?</p>

<p>Love to man leads to devotion&mdash;grand
and sublime images strike the
imagination&mdash;God is seen in every
floating cloud, and comes from the
misty mountain to receive the noblest
homage of an intelligent creature&mdash;praise.
How solemn is the moment,
when all affections and remembrances
fade before the sublime admiration
which the wisdom and goodness of God
inspires, when he is worshipped in a
<i>temple not made with hands</i>, and the
world seems to contain only the mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-164" id="DPg_4-164"></a>[<a href="images/v4-164.png">164</a>]</span>
that formed, and the mind that contemplates
it! These are not the weak
responses of ceremonial devotion; nor,
to express them, would the poet need
another poet's aid: his heart burns
within him, and he speaks the language
of truth and nature with resistless
energy.</p>

<p>Inequalities, of course, are observable
in his effusions; and a less vigorous
fancy, with more taste, would
have produced more elegance and uniformity;
but, as passages are softened
or expunged during the cooler moments
of reflection, the understanding
is gratified at the expence of those involuntary
sensations, which, like the
beauteous tints of an evening sky, are
so evanescent, that they melt into new
forms before they can be analyzed. For
however eloquently we may boast of<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-165" id="DPg_4-165"></a>[<a href="images/v4-165.png">165</a>]</span>
our reason, man must often be delighted
he cannot tell why, or his blunt
feelings are not made to relish the beauties
which nature, poetry, or any of
the imitative arts, afford.</p>

<p>The imagery of the ancients seems
naturally to have been borrowed from
surrounding objects and their mythology.
When a hero is to be transported
from one place to another, across
pathless wastes, is any vehicle so natural,
as one of the fleecy clouds on which
the poet has often gazed, scarcely conscious
that he wished to make it his
chariot? Again, when nature seems
to present obstacles to his progress at
almost every step, when the tangled
forest and steep mountain stand as barriers,
to pass over which the mind
longs for supernatural aid; an interposing
deity, who walks on the waves,<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-166" id="DPg_4-166"></a>[<a href="images/v4-166.png">166</a>]</span>
and rules the storm, severely felt in the
first attempts to cultivate a country,
will receive from the impassioned fancy
"a local habitation and a name."</p>

<p>It would be a philosophical enquiry,
and throw some light on the history of
the human mind, to trace, as far as our
information will allow us to trace, the
spontaneous feelings and ideas which
have produced the images that now
frequently appear unnatural, because
they are remote; and disgusting, because
they have been servilely copied
by poets, whose habits of thinking,
and views of nature must have been
different; for, though the understanding
seldom disturbs the current of our present
feelings, without dissipating the
gay clouds which fancy has been embracing,
yet it silently gives the colour
to the whole tenour of them, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-167" id="DPg_4-167"></a>[<a href="images/v4-167.png">167</a>]</span>
dream is over, when truth is grossly
violated, or images introduced, selected
from books, and not from local manners
or popular prejudices.</p>

<p>In a more advanced state of civilization,
a poet is rather the creature of
art, than of nature. The books that he
reads in his youth, become a hot-bed
in which artificial fruits are produced,
beautiful to the common eye, though
they want the true hue and flavour.
His images do not arise from sensations;
they are copies; and, like the works
of the painters who copy ancient statues
when they draw men and women
of their own times, we acknowledge
that the features are fine, and the proportions
just; yet they are men of
stone; insipid figures, that never convey
to the mind the idea of a portrait
taken from life, where the soul gives<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-168" id="DPg_4-168"></a>[<a href="images/v4-168.png">168</a>]</span>
spirit and homogeneity to the whole.
The silken wings of fancy are shrivelled
by rules; and a desire of attaining
elegance of diction, occasions an attention
to words, incompatible with
sublime, impassioned thoughts.</p>

<p>A boy of abilities, who has been
taught the structure of verse at school,
and been roused by emulation to compose
rhymes whilst he was reading
works of genius, may, by practice,
produce pretty verses, and even become
what is often termed an elegant
poet: yet his readers, without knowing
what to find fault with, do not
find themselves warmly interested. In
the works of the poets who fasten on
their affections, they see grosser faults,
and the very images which shock their
taste in the modern; still they do not appear
as puerile or extrinsic in one as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-169" id="DPg_4-169"></a>[<a href="images/v4-169.png">169</a>]</span>
other.&mdash;Why?&mdash;because they did not
appear so to the author.</p>

<p>It may sound paradoxical, after observing
that those productions want
vigour, that are merely the work of
imitation, in which the understanding
has violently directed, if not extinguished,
the blaze of fancy, to assert, that,
though genius be only another word
for exquisite sensibility, the first observers
of nature, the true poets, exercised
their understanding much more
than their imitators. But they exercised
it to discriminate things, whilst
their followers were busy to borrow
sentiments and arrange words.</p>

<p>Boys who have received a classical
education, load their memory with
words, and the correspondent ideas
are perhaps never distinctly comprehended.
As a proof of this assertion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-170" id="DPg_4-170"></a>[<a href="images/v4-170.png">170</a>]</span>
I must observe, that I have known
many young people who could write
tolerably smooth verses, and string epithets
prettily together, when their
prose themes showed the barrenness of
their minds, and how superficial the
cultivation must have been, which
their understanding had received.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson, I know, has given a definition
of genius, which would overturn
my reasoning, if I were to admit
it.&mdash;He imagines, that <i>a strong mind,
accidentally led to some particular study</i> in
which it excels, is a genius.&mdash;Not to
stop to investigate the causes which
produced this happy <i>strength</i> of mind,
experience seems to prove, that those
minds have appeared most vigorous,
that have pursued a study, after nature
had discovered a bent; for it would be
absurd to suppose, that a slight impres<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-171" id="DPg_4-171"></a>[<a href="images/v4-171.png">171</a>]</span>sion
made on the weak faculties of a
boy, is the fiat of fate, and not to be
effaced by any succeeding impression,
or unexpected difficulty. Dr. Johnson
in fact, appears sometimes to be of the
same opinion (how consistently I shall
not now enquire), especially when he
observes, "that Thomson looked on
nature with the eye which she only
gives to a poet."</p>

<p>But, though it should be allowed
that books may produce some poets, I
fear they will never be the poets who
charm our cares to sleep, or extort admiration.
They may diffuse taste, and
polish the language; but I am inclined
to conclude that they will seldom rouse
the passions, or amend the heart.</p>

<p>And, to return to the first subject of
discussion, the reason why most people
are more interested by a scene describ<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-172" id="DPg_4-172"></a>[<a href="images/v4-172.png">172</a>]</span>ed
by a poet, than by a view of nature,
probably arises from the want of a
lively imagination. The poet contracts
the prospect, and, selecting the most
picturesque part in his <i>camera</i>, the judgment
is directed, and the whole force
of the languid faculty turned towards
the objects which excited the most
forcible emotions in the poet's heart;
the reader consequently feels the enlivened
description, though he was not
able to receive a first impression from
the operations of his own mind.</p>

<p>Besides, it may be further observed,
that gross minds are only to be moved
by forcible representations. To rouse
the thoughtless, objects must be presented,
calculated to produce tumultuous
emotions; the unsubstantial, picturesque
forms which a contemplative
man gazes on, and often follows with<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-173" id="DPg_4-173"></a>[<a href="images/v4-173.png">173</a>]</span>
ardour till he is mocked by a glimpse
of unattainable excellence, appear to
them the light vapours of a dreaming
enthusiast, who gives up the substance
for the shadow. It is not within that
they seek amusement; their eyes are
seldom turned on themselves; consequently
their emotions, though sometimes
fervid, are always transient, and
the nicer perceptions which distinguish
the man of genuine taste, are not felt,
or make such a slight impression as
scarcely to excite any pleasurable sensations.
Is it surprising then that they
are often overlooked, even by those
who are delighted by the same images
concentrated by the poet?</p>

<p>But even this numerous class is exceeded,
by witlings, who, anxious
to appear to have wit and taste, do
not allow their understandings or feel<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-174" id="DPg_4-174"></a>[<a href="images/v4-174.png">174</a>]</span>ings
any liberty; for, instead of cultivating
their faculties and reflecting on
their operations, they are busy collecting
prejudices; and are predetermined
to admire what the suffrage of time
announces as excellent, not to store up
a fund of amusement for themselves,
but to enable them to talk.</p>

<p>These hints will assist the reader to
trace some of the causes why the beauties
of nature are not forcibly felt,
when civilization, or rather luxury,
has made considerable advances&mdash;those
calm sensations are not sufficiently
lively to serve as a relaxation to the voluptuary,
or even to the moderate pursuer
of artificial pleasures. In the present
state of society, the understanding
must bring back the feelings to nature,
or the sensibility must have such native
strength, as rather to be whetted than<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-175" id="DPg_4-175"></a>[<a href="images/v4-175.png">175</a>]</span>
destroyed by the strong exercises of
passion.</p>

<p>That the most valuable things are liable
to the greatest perversion, is however
as trite as true:&mdash;for the same sensibility,
or quickness of senses, which
makes a man relish the tranquil scenes
of nature, when sensation, rather than
reason, imparts delight, frequently makes
a libertine of him, by leading him to
prefer the sensual tumult of love a
little refined by sentiment, to the calm
pleasures of affectionate friendship, in
whose sober satisfactions, reason, mixing
her tranquillizing convictions, whispers,
that content, not happiness, is the
reward of virtue in this world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Indolence</span> is the source of nervous
complaints, and a whole host of
cares. This devil might say that his
name was legion.</p>

<p class="center">2.</p>
<p>It should be one of the employments
of women of fortune, to visit hospitals,
and superintend the conduct of inferiors.</p>

<p class="center">3.</p>
<p>It is generally supposed, that the
imagination of women is particularly<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-180" id="DPg_4-180"></a>[<a href="images/v4-180.png">180</a>]</span>
active, and leads them astray. Why
then do we seek by education only to
exercise their imagination and feeling,
till the understanding, grown rigid by
disuse, is unable to exercise itself&mdash;and
the superfluous nourishment the
imagination and feeling have received,
renders the former romantic, and the
latter weak?</p>

<p class="center">4.</p>
<p>Few men have risen to any great
eminence in learning, who have not
received something like a regular education.
Why are women expected to
surmount difficulties that men are not
equal to?</p>

<p class="center">5.</p>
<p>Nothing can be more absurd than
the ridicule of the critic, that the heroine
of his mock-tragedy was in love
with the very man whom she ought<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-181" id="DPg_4-181"></a>[<a href="images/v4-181.png">181</a>]</span>
least to have loved; he could not have
given a better reason. How can passion
gain strength any other way? In Otaheite,
love cannot be known, where
the obstacles to irritate an indiscriminate
appetite, and sublimate the simple
sensations of desire till they mount to
passion, are never known. There a
man or woman cannot love the very
person they ought not to have loved&mdash;nor
does jealousy ever fan the flame.</p>

<p class="center">6.</p>
<p>It has frequently been observed, that,
when women have an object in view,
they pursue it with more steadiness than
men, particularly love. This is not
a compliment. Passion pursues with
more heat than reason, and with most
ardour during the absence of reason.</p>

<p class="center">7.</p>
<p>Men are more subject to the physical<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-182" id="DPg_4-182"></a>[<a href="images/v4-182.png">182</a>]</span>
love than women. The confined education
of women makes them more
subject to jealousy.</p>

<p class="center">8.</p>
<p>Simplicity seems, in general, the consequence
of ignorance, as I have observed
in the characters of women and
sailors&mdash;the being confined to one track
of impressions.</p>

<p class="center">9.</p>
<p>I know of no other way of preserving
the chastity of mankind, than that
of rendering women rather objects of
love than desire. The difference is
great. Yet, while women are encouraged
to ornament their persons at the
expence of their minds, while indolence
renders them helpless and lascivious
(for what other name can be
given to the common intercourse between
the sexes?) they will be, gene<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-183" id="DPg_4-183"></a>[<a href="images/v4-183.png">183</a>]</span>rally
speaking, only objects of desire;
and, to such women, men cannot be
constant. Men, accustomed only to
have their senses moved, merely seek
for a selfish gratification in the society
of women, and their sexual instinct,
being neither supported by the understanding
nor the heart, must be excited
by variety.</p>

<p class="center">10.</p>
<p>We ought to respect old opinions;
though prejudices, blindly adopted,
lead to error, and preclude all exercise
of the reason.</p>

<p>The emulation which often makes a
boy mischievous, is a generous spur;
and the old remark, that unlucky, turbulent
boys, make the wisest and best
men, is true, spite of Mr. Knox's arguments.
It has been observed, that the
most adventurous horses, when tamed<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-184" id="DPg_4-184"></a>[<a href="images/v4-184.png">184</a>]</span>
or domesticated, are the most mild and
tractable.</p>

<p class="center">11.</p>
<p>The children who start up suddenly
at twelve or fourteen, and fall into decays,
in consequence, as it is termed,
of outgrowing their strength, are in
general, I believe, those children, who
have been bred up with mistaken tenderness,
and not allowed to sport and
take exercise in the open air. This is
analogous to plants: for it is found that
they run up sickly, long stalks, when
confined.</p>

<p class="center">12.</p>
<p>Children should be taught to feel deference,
not to practise submission.</p>

<p class="center">13.</p>
<p>It is always a proof of false refinement,
when a fastidious taste overpowers
sympathy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-185" id="DPg_4-185"></a>[<a href="images/v4-185.png">185</a>]</span></p>
<p class="center">14.</p>
<p>Lust appears to be the most natural
companion of wild ambition; and love
of human praise, of that dominion
erected by cunning.</p>

<p class="center">15.</p>
<p>"Genius decays as judgment increases."
Of course, those who have
the least genius, have the earliest appearance
of wisdom.</p>

<p class="center">16.</p>
<p>A knowledge of the fine arts, is seldom
subservient to the promotion of
either religion or virtue. Elegance is
often indecency; witness our prints.</p>

<p class="center">17.</p>
<p>There does not appear to be any evil
in the world, but what is necessary.
The doctrine of rewards and punishments,
not considered as a means of re<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-186" id="DPg_4-186"></a>[<a href="images/v4-186.png">186</a>]</span>formation,
appears to me an infamous
libel on divine goodness.</p>

<p class="center">18.</p>
<p>Whether virtue is founded on reason
or revelation, virtue is wisdom, and
vice is folly. Why are positive punishments?</p>

<p class="center">19.</p>
<p>Few can walk alone. The staff of
Christianity is the necessary support of
human weakness. But an acquaintance
with the nature of man and virtue,
with just sentiments on the attributes,
would be sufficient, without a voice
from heaven, to lead some to virtue,
but not the mob.</p>

<p class="center">20.</p>
<p>I only expect the natural reward of
virtue, whatever it may be. I rely not
on a positive reward.</p>

<p>The justice of God can be vindicated<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-187" id="DPg_4-187"></a>[<a href="images/v4-187.png">187</a>]</span>
by a belief in a future state&mdash;but a continuation
of being vindicates it as
clearly, as the positive system of rewards
and punishments&mdash;by evil educing
good for the individual, and not
for an imaginary whole. The happiness
of the whole must arise from the
happiness of the constituent parts, or
this world is not a state of trial, but a
school.</p>

<p class="center">21.</p>
<p>The vices acquired by Augustus to
retain his power, must have tainted his
soul, and prevented that increase of
happiness a good man expects in the
next stage of existence. This was a
natural punishment.</p>

<p class="center">22.</p>
<p>The lover is ever most deeply enamoured,
when it is with he knows
not what&mdash;and the devotion of a mystic<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-188" id="DPg_4-188"></a>[<a href="images/v4-188.png">188</a>]</span>
has a rude Gothic grandeur in it, which
the respectful adoration of a philosopher
will never reach. I may be
thought fanciful; but it has continually
occurred to me, that, though, I allow,
reason in this world is the mother
of wisdom&mdash;yet some flights of the imagination
seem to reach what wisdom
cannot teach&mdash;and, while they delude
us here, afford a glorious hope, if not
a foretaste, of what we may expect
hereafter. He that created us, did not
mean to mark us with ideal images of
grandeur, the <i>baseless fabric of a vision</i>&mdash;No&mdash;that
perfection we follow with
hopeless ardour when the whisperings
of reason are heard, may be found,
when not incompatible with our state,
in the round of eternity. Perfection
indeed must, even then, be a comparative
idea&mdash;but the wisdom, the hap<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-189" id="DPg_4-189"></a>[<a href="images/v4-189.png">189</a>]</span>piness
of a superior state, has been supposed
to be intuitive, and the happiest
effusions of human genius have seemed
like inspiration&mdash;the deductions of reason
destroy sublimity.</p>

<p class="center">23.</p>
<p>I am more and more convinced, that
poetry is the first effervescence of the
imagination, and the forerunner of civilization.</p>

<p class="center">24.</p>
<p>When the Arabs had no trace of literature
or science, they composed
beautiful verses on the subjects of love
and war. The flights of the imagination,
and the laboured deductions of
reason, appear almost incompatible.</p>

<p class="center">25.</p>
<p>Poetry certainly flourishes most in
the first rude state of society. The
passions speak most eloquently, when
they are not shackled by reason. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-190" id="DPg_4-190"></a>[<a href="images/v4-190.png">190</a>]</span>
sublime expression, which has been so
often quoted, [Genesis, ch. 1, ver. 3.]
is perhaps a barbarous flight; or rather
the grand conception of an uncultivated
mind; for it is contrary to nature
and experience, to suppose that this
account is founded on facts&mdash;It is
doubtless a sublime allegory. But a
cultivated mind would not thus have
described the creation&mdash;for, arguing
from analogy, it appears that creation
must have been a comprehensive plan,
and that the Supreme Being always
uses second causes, slowly and silently
to fulfil his purpose. This is, in reality,
a more sublime view of that power
which wisdom supports: but it is not
the sublimity that would strike the impassioned
mind, in which the imagination
took place of intellect. Tell a
being, whose affections and passions
have been more exercised than his rea<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-191" id="DPg_4-191"></a>[<a href="images/v4-191.png">191</a>]</span>son,
that God said, <i>Let there be light!
and there was light</i>; and he would prostrate
himself before the Being who
could thus call things out of nothing,
as if they were: but a man in whom
reason had taken place of passion,
would not adore, till wisdom was conspicuous
as well as power, for his admiration
must be founded on principle.</p>

<p class="center">26.</p>
<p>Individuality is ever conspicuous in
those enthusiastic flights of fancy, in
which reason is left behind, without
being lost sight of.</p>

<p class="center">27.</p>
<p>The mind has been too often brought
to the test of enquiries which only
reach to matter&mdash;put into the crucible,
though the magnetic and electric fluid
escapes from the experimental philosopher.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-192" id="DPg_4-192"></a>[<a href="images/v4-192.png">192</a>]</span></p>
<p class="center">28.</p>
<p>Mr. Kant has observed, that the understanding
is sublime, the imagination
beautiful&mdash;yet it is evident, that poets,
and men who undoubtedly possess the
liveliest imagination, are most touched
by the sublime, while men who have
cold, enquiring minds, have not this
exquisite feeling in any great degree,
and indeed seem to lose it as they cultivate
their reason.</p>

<p class="center">29.</p>
<p>The Grecian buildings are graceful&mdash;they
fill the mind with all those pleasing
emotions, which elegance and beauty
never fail to excite in a cultivated
mind&mdash;utility and grace strike us in
unison&mdash;the mind is satisfied&mdash;things
appear just what they ought to be: a
calm satisfaction is felt, but the imagination
has nothing to do&mdash;no obscurity<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-193" id="DPg_4-193"></a>[<a href="images/v4-193.png">193</a>]</span>
darkens the gloom&mdash;like reasonable
content, we can say why we are pleased&mdash;and
this kind of pleasure may be
lasting, but it is never great.</p>

<p class="center">30.</p>
<p>When we say that a person is an
original, it is only to say in other words
that he thinks. "The less a man has
cultivated his rational faculties, the
more powerful is the principle of
imitation, over his actions, and his
habits of thinking. Most women,
of course, are more influenced by
the behaviour, the fashions, and the
opinions of those with whom they
associate, than men." (Smellie.)</p>

<p>When we read a book which supports
our favourite opinions, how eagerly
do we suck in the doctrines, and
suffer our minds placidly to reflect the
images which illustrate the tenets we<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-194" id="DPg_4-194"></a>[<a href="images/v4-194.png">194</a>]</span>
have embraced? We indolently or
quietly acquiesce in the conclusion, and
our spirit animates and connects the
various subjects. But, on the contrary,
when we peruse a skilful writer,
who does not coincide in opinion with
us, how is the mind on the watch to
detect fallacy? And this coolness often
prevents our being carried away by a
stream of eloquence, which the prejudiced
mind terms declamation&mdash;a pomp
of words.&mdash;We never allow ourselves to
be warmed; and, after contending
with the writer, are more confirmed
in our own opinion, as much perhaps
from a spirit of contradiction as from
reason.&mdash;Such is the strength of man!</p>

<p class="center">31.</p>
<p>It is the individual manner of seeing
and feeling, pourtrayed by a strong
imagination in bold images that have<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-195" id="DPg_4-195"></a>[<a href="images/v4-195.png">195</a>]</span>
struck the senses, which creates all the
charms of poetry. A great reader is
always quoting the description of another's
emotions; a strong imagination
delights to paint its own. A writer of
genius makes us feel; an inferior author
reason.</p>

<p class="center">32.</p>
<p>Some principle prior to self-love must
have existed: the feeling which produced
the pleasure, must have existed
before the experience.</p>

much affection, and the agonies of a

pourtrayed!&mdash;What more then had
I to &#383;ay?&mdash;The negative was to come
from you.&mdash;You had perpetually recurred
to your promi&#383;e of meeting me
in the autumn&mdash;Was it extraordinary
that I &#383;hould demand a yes, or no?&mdash;Your
letter is written with extreme
har&#383;hne&#383;s, coldne&#383;s I am accu&#383;tomed

of humanity, much le&#383;s of friend&#383;hip.&mdash;I
only &#383;ee a de&#383;ire to heave a
load off your &#383;houlders.</p>

The tremendous power who formed
this heart, mu&#383;t have fore&#383;een that, in
a world in which &#383;elf-intere&#383;t, in various
&#383;hapes, is the principal mobile, I
had little chance of e&#383;caping mi&#383;ery.&mdash;To
the fiat of fate I &#383;ubmit.&mdash;I am content
to be wretched; but I will not be
contemptible.&mdash;Of me you have no
cau&#383;e to complain, but for having had
too much regard for you&mdash;for having
expected a degree of permanent happine&#383;s,
when you only &#383;ought for a
momentary gratification.</p>

<p>I am &#383;trangely deficient in &#383;agacity.&mdash;Uniting
my&#383;elf to you, your tenderne&#383;s
&#383;eemed to make me amends for all my
former mi&#383;fortunes.&mdash;On this tenderne&#383;s
and affection with what confidence
did I re&#383;t!&mdash;but I leaned on a &#383;pear, that
has pierced me to the heart.&mdash;You
have thrown off a faithful friend, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-4_S" id="DPg_4-4_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-4.png">4</a>]</span>
pur&#383;ue the caprices of the moment.&mdash;We
certainly are differently organized;
for even now, when conviction has
been &#383;tamped on my &#383;oul by &#383;orrow, I
can &#383;carcely believe it po&#383;&#383;ible. It depends
at pre&#383;ent on you, whether you
will &#383;ee me or not.&mdash;I &#383;hall take no
&#383;tep, till I &#383;ee or hear from you.</p>

<p>Preparing my&#383;elf for the wor&#383;t&mdash;I
have determined, if your next letter be
like the la&#383;t, to write to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
to procure me an ob&#383;cure lodging, and
not to inform any body of my arrival.&mdash;There
I will endeavour in a few months
to obtain the &#383;um nece&#383;&#383;ary to take me
to France&mdash;from you I will not receive
any more.&mdash;I am not yet &#383;ufficiently
humbled to depend on your beneficence.</p>

<p>Some people, whom my unhappine&#383;s
has intere&#383;ted, though they know<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-5_S" id="DPg_4-5_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-5.png">5</a>]</span>
not the extent of it, will a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t me to
attain the object I have in view, the
independence of my child. Should a
peace take place, ready money will go
a great way in France&mdash;and I will borrow
a &#383;um, which my indu&#383;try <i>&#383;hall</i>
enable me to pay at my lei&#383;ure, to purcha&#383;e
a &#383;mall e&#383;tate for my girl.&mdash;The
a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance I &#383;hall find nece&#383;&#383;ary to complete
her education, I can get at an
ea&#383;y rate at Paris&mdash;I can introduce her
to &#383;uch &#383;ociety as &#383;he will like&mdash;and
thus, &#383;ecuring for her all the chance
for happine&#383;s, which depends on me, I
&#383;hall die in peace, per&#383;uaded that the
felicity which has hitherto cheated
my expectation, will not always elude
my gra&#383;p. No poor tempe&#383;t-to&#383;&#383;ed
mariner ever more earne&#383;tly longed to
arrive at his port.</p>

<p class="right">Sunday, October 4.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I wrote</span> to you by the packet, to
inform you, that your letter of the 18th
of la&#383;t month, had determined me to
&#383;et out with captain &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;; but, as
we &#383;ailed very quick, I take it for

You &#383;ay, I mu&#383;t decide for my&#383;elf.&mdash;I
had decided, that it was mo&#383;t for the
intere&#383;t of my little girl, and for my
own comfort, little as I expect, for us
to live together; and I even thought
that you would be glad, &#383;ome years
hence, when the tumult of bu&#383;ine&#383;s was
over, to repo&#383;e in the &#383;ociety of an affectionate
friend, and mark the progre&#383;s
of our intere&#383;ting child, whil&#383;t endeavouring
to be of u&#383;e in the circle you
at la&#383;t re&#383;olved to re&#383;t in; for you cannot
run about for ever.</p>

<p>From the tenour of your la&#383;t letter
however, I am led to imagine, that you
have formed &#383;ome new attachment.&mdash;If
it be &#383;o, let me earne&#383;tly reque&#383;t you
to &#383;ee me once more, and immediately.
This is the only proof I require of the
friend&#383;hip you profe&#383;s for me. I will<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-8_S" id="DPg_4-8_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-8.png">8</a>]</span>

mere form.</p>

<p>I am labouring to write with calmne&#383;s&mdash;but
the extreme angui&#383;h I feel,
at landing without having any friend
to receive me, and even to be con&#383;cious
that the friend whom I mo&#383;t wi&#383;h
to &#383;ee, will feel a di&#383;agreeable &#383;en&#383;ation
at being informed of my arrival, does
not come under the de&#383;cription of common
mi&#383;ery. Every emotion yields to
an overwhelming flood of &#383;orrow&mdash;and
the playfulne&#383;s of my child di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;es
me.&mdash;On her account, I wi&#383;hed
to remain a few days here, comfortle&#383;s
as is my &#383;ituation.&mdash;Be&#383;ides, I did not
wi&#383;h to &#383;urpri&#383;e you. You have told
me, that you would make any &#383;acrifice
to promote my happine&#383;s&mdash;and, even in
your la&#383;t unkind letter, you talk of the
ties which bind you to me and my<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-9_S" id="DPg_4-9_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-9.png">9</a>]</span>
child.&mdash;Tell me, that you wi&#383;h it, and
I will cut this Gordian knot.</p>

<p>I now mo&#383;t earne&#383;tly intreat you to
write to me, without fail, by the return
of the po&#383;t. Direct your letter to
be left at the po&#383;t-office, and tell me
whether you will come to me here, or
where you will meet me. I can receive
your letter on Wedne&#383;day morning.</p>

<p>Do not keep me in &#383;u&#383;pen&#383;e.&mdash;I expect
nothing from you, or any human
being: my die is ca&#383;t!&mdash;I have fortitude
enough to determine to do my
duty; yet I cannot rai&#383;e my depre&#383;&#383;ed
&#383;pirits, or calm my trembling heart.&mdash;That
being who moulded it thus,
knows that I am unable to tear up by
the roots the propen&#383;ity to affection
which has been the torment of my life&mdash;but
life will have an end!</p>

inhumanly brought back to life and

not to be baffled by di&#383;appointment;

which was one of the calme&#383;t

<h4>LETTER LXXV</h4>

<p class="right">London, November 27.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> letter, without an addre&#383;s,
which you put up with the letters you
returned, did not meet my eyes till
ju&#383;t now.&mdash;I had thrown the letters
a&#383;ide&mdash;I did not wi&#383;h to look over a
regi&#383;ter of &#383;orrow.</p>

<p>My not having &#383;een it, will account
for my having written to you with
anger&mdash;under the impre&#383;&#383;ion your departure,
without even a line left for me,
made on me, even after your late conduct,
which could not lead me to expect
much attention to my &#383;ufferings.</p>

<p>In fact, "the decided conduct, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-23_S" id="DPg_4-23_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-23.png">23</a>]</span>
appeared to me &#383;o unfeeling," has almo&#383;t
overturned my rea&#383;on; my mind
is injured&mdash;I &#383;carcely know where I
am, or what I do.&mdash;The grief I cannot
conquer (for &#383;ome cruel recollections
never quit me, bani&#383;hing almo&#383;t every
other) I labour to conceal in total
&#383;olitude.&mdash;My life therefore is but an
exerci&#383;e of fortitude, continually on
the &#383;tretch&mdash;and hope never gleams in
this tomb, where I am buried alive.</p>

<p>But I meant to rea&#383;on with you, and
not to complain.&mdash;You tell me, "that I
&#383;hall judge more coolly of your mode
of acting, &#383;ome time hence." But is it
not po&#383;&#383;ible that <i>pa&#383;&#383;ion</i> clouds your rea&#383;on,
as much as it does mine?&mdash;and
ought you not to doubt, whether tho&#383;e
principles are &#383;o "exalted," as you
term them, which only lead to your
own gratification? In other words,<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-24_S" id="DPg_4-24_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-24.png">24</a>]</span>
whether it be ju&#383;t to have no principle
of action, but that of following your
inclination, trampling on the affection
you have fo&#383;tered, and the expectations
you have excited?</p>

<p>My affection for you is rooted in my
heart.&mdash;I know you are not what you
now &#383;eem&mdash;nor will you always act, or
feel, as you now do, though I may
never be comforted by the change.&mdash;Even
at Paris, my image will haunt
you.&mdash;You will &#383;ee my pale face&mdash;and
&#383;ometimes the tears of angui&#383;h will
drop on your heart, which you have
forced from mine.</p>

<p>I cannot write. I thought I could
quickly have refuted all your <i>ingenious</i>
arguments; but my head is confu&#383;ed.&mdash;Right
or wrong, I am mi&#383;erable!</p>

<p>It &#383;eems to me, that my conduct has
always been governed by the &#383;tricte&#383;t
principles of ju&#383;tice and truth.&mdash;Yet,<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-25_S" id="DPg_4-25_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-25.png">25</a>]</span>
how wretched have my &#383;ocial feelings,
and delicacy of &#383;entiment rendered me!&mdash;I
have loved with my whole &#383;oul,
only to di&#383;cover that I had no chance
of a return&mdash;and that exi&#383;tence is a
burthen without it.</p>

<p>I do not perfectly under&#383;tand you.&mdash;If,
by the offer of your friend&#383;hip, you
&#383;till only mean pecuniary &#383;upport&mdash;I
mu&#383;t again reject it.&mdash;Trifling are the
ills of poverty in the &#383;cale of my mi&#383;fortunes.&mdash;God
ble&#383;s you!</p>

<p class="right">* * * *</p>

<p>I have been treated ungenerou&#383;ly&mdash;if
I under&#383;tand what is genero&#383;ity.&mdash;&mdash;You
&#383;eem to me only to have been
anxious to &#383;hake me off&mdash;regardle&#383;s
whether you da&#383;hed me to atoms by
the fall.&mdash;In truth I have been rudely
handled. <i>Do you judge coolly</i>, and I tru&#383;t<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-26_S" id="DPg_4-26_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-26.png">26</a>]</span>
you will not continue to call tho&#383;e capricious
feelings "the mo&#383;t refined,"
which would undermine not only the
mo&#383;t &#383;acred principles, but the affections
which unite mankind.&mdash;&mdash;You
would render mothers unnatural&mdash;and
there would be no &#383;uch thing as a father!&mdash;If
your theory of morals is the
mo&#383;t "exalted," it is certainly the mo&#383;t
ea&#383;y.&mdash;It does not require much magnanimity,
to determine to plea&#383;e our&#383;elves
for the moment, let others &#383;uffer
what they will!</p>

<p>Excu&#383;e me for again tormenting you,
my heart thir&#383;ts for ju&#383;tice from you&mdash;and
whil&#383;t I recollect that you approved
Mi&#383;s &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s conduct&mdash;I am convinced
you will not always ju&#383;tify your
own.</p>

<p>Beware of the deceptions of pa&#383;&#383;ion!
It will not always bani&#383;h from your<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-27_S" id="DPg_4-27_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-27.png">27</a>]</span>
mind, that you have acted ignobly&mdash;and
conde&#383;cended to &#383;ubterfuge to
glo&#383;s over the conduct you could not
excu&#383;e.&mdash;Do truth and principle require
&#383;uch &#383;acrifices?</p>

Paris, I would not mi&#383;s a &#383;ure opportunity

I began even now to write calmly,

<p>I am &#383;tunned!&mdash;Your late conduct

could almo&#383;t &#383;ay cunning, unworthy of
you?&mdash;Principles are &#383;acred things&mdash;and
we never play with truth, with
impunity.</p>

<p>The expectation (I have too fondly
nouri&#383;hed it) of regaining your affection,
every day grows fainter and

to inferior gratifications. In a comfortle&#383;s
old age, you will remember
that you had one di&#383;intere&#383;ted friend,
who&#383;e heart you wounded to the quick.
The hour of recollection will come&mdash;and
you will not be &#383;ati&#383;fied to act the
part of a boy, till you fall into that of a
dotard. I know that your mind, your
heart, and your principles of action,
are all &#383;uperior to your pre&#383;ent conduct.
You do, you mu&#383;t, re&#383;pect me&mdash;and
you will be &#383;orry to forfeit my e&#383;teem.</p>

<p>You know be&#383;t whether I am &#383;till

<h4>LETTER LXXVII</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the parting from you for ever is
the mo&#383;t &#383;erious event of my life, I will
once expo&#383;tulate with you, and call
not the language of truth and feeling
ingenuity!</p>

<p>I know the &#383;oundne&#383;s of your under&#383;tanding&mdash;and
know that it is impo&#383;&#383;ible
for you always to confound the
caprices of every wayward inclination
with the manly dictates of principle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-32_S" id="DPg_4-32_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-32.png">32</a>]</span>
You tell me "that I torment you."&mdash;Why
do I?&mdash;&mdash;Becau&#383;e you cannot
e&#383;trange your heart entirely from me&mdash;and
you feel that ju&#383;tice is on my &#383;ide.
You urge, "that your conduct was
unequivocal."&mdash;It was not.&mdash;When
your coolne&#383;s has hurt me, with what
tenderne&#383;s have you endeavoured to
remove the impre&#383;&#383;ion!&mdash;and even before
I returned to England, you took
great pains to convince me, that all
my unea&#383;ine&#383;s was occa&#383;ioned by the
effect of a worn-out con&#383;titution&mdash;and
you concluded your letter with the&#383;e
words, "Bu&#383;ine&#383;s alone has kept me
from you.&mdash;Come to any port, and I
will fly down to my two dear girls
with a heart all their own."</p>

<p>With the&#383;e a&#383;&#383;urances, is it extraordinary
that I &#383;hould believe what I
wi&#383;hed? I might&mdash;and did think that<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-33_S" id="DPg_4-33_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-33.png">33</a>]</span>
you had a &#383;truggle with old propen&#383;ities;
but I &#383;till thought that I and virtue
&#383;hould at la&#383;t prevail. I &#383;till thought
that you had a magnanimity of character,
which would enable you to conquer
your&#383;elf.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, believe me, it is not
romance, you have acknowledged to
me feelings of this kind.&mdash;You could
re&#383;tore me to life and hope, and the

amply repay you.</p>

<p>In tearing my&#383;elf from you, it is my

come, when you will lament that you
have thrown away a heart, that, even
in the moment of pa&#383;&#383;ion, you cannot
de&#383;pi&#383;e.&mdash;I would owe every thing to

re&#383;pect to the child.&mdash;I could wi&#383;h that
it might be done &#383;oon, that my name
may be no more mentioned to you.
It is now fini&#383;hed.&mdash;Convinced that you
have neither regard nor friend&#383;hip, I
di&#383;dain to utter a reproach, though I
have had rea&#383;on to think, that the
"forbearance" talked of, has not been
very delicate.&mdash;It is however of no
con&#383;equence.&mdash;I am glad you are &#383;ati&#383;fied

That there is "&#383;ophi&#383;try" on one
&#383;ide or other, is certain; but now it

has not been a que&#383;tion of words. Yet
your under&#383;tanding or mine mu&#383;t be
&#383;trangely warped&mdash;for what you term
"delicacy," appears to me to be exactly
the contrary. I have no criterion
for morality, and have thought in vain,
if the &#383;en&#383;ations which lead you to follow
an ancle or &#383;tep, be the &#383;acred
foundation of principle and affection.
Mine has been of a very different nature,
or it would not have &#383;tood the
brunt of your &#383;arca&#383;ms.</p>

<p>The &#383;entiment in me is &#383;till &#383;acred.
If there be any part of me that will
&#383;urvive the &#383;en&#383;e of my mi&#383;fortunes, it
is the purity of my affections. The
impetuo&#383;ity of your &#383;en&#383;es, may have
led you to term mere animal de&#383;ire, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-36_S" id="DPg_4-36_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-36.png">36</a>]</span>

ze&#383;t to &#383;ome years to come.&mdash;Whether
you will always think &#383;o, I &#383;hall never
know.</p>

<p>It is &#383;trange that, in &#383;pite of all you
do, &#383;omething like conviction forces me
to believe, that you are not what you
appear to be.</p>

<p>I part with you in peace.</p>

<h3><i>Introductory to a Series of Letters on the Pre&#383;ent
Character of the French Nation.</i></h3>
<hr class="short" />

<p class="right">Paris, February 15, 1793.</p>

<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; My dear friend,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is nece&#383;&#383;ary perhaps for an ob&#383;erver
of mankind, to guard as carefully the
remembrance of the fir&#383;t impre&#383;&#383;ion
made by a nation, as by a countenance;
becau&#383;e we imperceptibly lo&#383;e &#383;ight of
the national character, when we become
more intimate with individuals.
It is not then u&#383;ele&#383;s or pre&#383;umptuous
to note, that, when I fir&#383;t entered Paris,<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-40_S" id="DPg_4-40_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-40.png">40</a>]</span>
the &#383;triking contra&#383;t of riches and poverty,
elegance and &#383;lovenline&#383;s, urbanity
and deceit, every where caught
my eye, and &#383;addened my &#383;oul; and
the&#383;e impre&#383;&#383;ions are &#383;till the foundation
of my remarks on the manners, which
flatter the &#383;en&#383;es, more than they intere&#383;t
the heart, and yet excite more intere&#383;t
than e&#383;teem.</p>

<p>The whole mode of life here tends
indeed to render the people frivolous,
and, to borrow their favourite epithet,
amiable. Ever on the wing, they are
always &#383;ipping the &#383;parkling joy on the
brim of the cup, leaving &#383;atiety in the
bottom for tho&#383;e who venture to drink
deep. On all &#383;ides they trip along,
buoyed up by animal &#383;pirits, and &#383;eemingly
&#383;o void of care, that often, when
I am walking on the <i>Boulevards</i>, it
occurs to me, that they alone under&#383;tand<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-41_S" id="DPg_4-41_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-41.png">41</a>]</span>
the full import of the term lei&#383;ure; and
they trifle their time away with &#383;uch
an air of contentment, I know not how
to wi&#383;h them wi&#383;er at the expence of
their gaiety. They play before me like
motes in a &#383;unbeam, enjoying the pa&#383;&#383;ing
ray; whil&#383;t an Engli&#383;h head, &#383;earching
for more &#383;olid happine&#383;s, lo&#383;es, in
the analy&#383;is of plea&#383;ure, the volatile
&#383;weets of the moment. Their chief
enjoyment, it is true, ri&#383;es from vanity:
but it is not the vanity that engenders
vexation of &#383;pirit; on the contrary, it
lightens the heavy burthen of life,
which rea&#383;on too often weighs, merely
to &#383;hift from one &#383;houlder to the
other.</p>

<p>Inve&#383;tigating the modification of the
pa&#383;&#383;ion, as I would analyze the elements
that give a form to dead matter, I
&#383;hall attempt to trace to their &#383;ource<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-42_S" id="DPg_4-42_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-42.png">42</a>]</span>
the cau&#383;es which have combined to
render this nation the mo&#383;t poli&#383;hed, in
a phy&#383;ical &#383;en&#383;e, and probably the mo&#383;t
&#383;uperficial in the world; and I mean to
follow the windings of the various
&#383;treams that di&#383;embogue into a terrific
gulf, in which all the dignity of our
nature is ab&#383;orbed. For every thing
has con&#383;pired to make the French the
mo&#383;t &#383;en&#383;ual people in the world; and
what can render the heart &#383;o hard, or
&#383;o effectually &#383;tifle every moral emotion,
as the refinements of &#383;en&#383;uality?</p>

<p>The frequent repetition of the word
French, appears invidious; let me then
make a previous ob&#383;ervation, which I
beg you not to lo&#383;e &#383;ight of, when I
&#383;peak rather har&#383;hly of a land flowing
with milk and honey. Remember that
it is not the morals of a particular
people that I would decry; for are we<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-43_S" id="DPg_4-43_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-43.png">43</a>]</span>
not all of the &#383;ame &#383;tock? But I wi&#383;h
calmly to con&#383;ider the &#383;tage of civilization
in which I find the French, and,
giving a &#383;ketch of their character, and
unfolding the circum&#383;tances which have
produced its identity, I &#383;hall endeavour
to throw &#383;ome light on the hi&#383;tory of
man, and on the pre&#383;ent important
&#383;ubjects of di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ion.</p>

<p>I would I could fir&#383;t inform you that,
out of the chaos of vices and follies,
prejudices and virtues, rudely jumbled
together, I &#383;aw the fair form of Liberty
&#383;lowly ri&#383;ing, and Virtue expanding her
wings to &#383;helter all her children! I
&#383;hould then hear the account of the
barbarities that have rent the bo&#383;om of
France patiently, and ble&#383;s the firm
hand that lopt off the rotten limbs.
But, if the ari&#383;tocracy of birth is levelled
with the ground, only to make room<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-44_S" id="DPg_4-44_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-44.png">44</a>]</span>
for that of riches, I am afraid that the
morals of the people will not be much
improved by the change, or the government
rendered le&#383;s venal. Still it
is not ju&#383;t to dwell on the mi&#383;ery produced
by the pre&#383;ent &#383;truggle, without
adverting to the &#383;tanding evils of the
old &#383;y&#383;tem. I am grieved&mdash;&#383;orely grieved&mdash;when
I think of the blood that has
&#383;tained the cau&#383;e of freedom at Paris;
but I al&#383;o hear the &#383;ame live &#383;tream cry
aloud from the highways, through
which the retreating armies pa&#383;&#383;ed
with famine and death in their rear,
and I hide my face with awe before
the in&#383;crutable ways of providence,
&#383;weeping in &#383;uch various directions the
be&#383;om of de&#383;truction over the &#383;ons of
men.</p>

<p>Before I came to France, I cheri&#383;hed,
you know, an opinion, that &#383;trong vir<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-45_S" id="DPg_4-45_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-45.png">45</a>]</span>tues
might exi&#383;t with the poli&#383;hed manners
produced by the progre&#383;s of civilization;
and I even anticipated the
epoch, when, in the cour&#383;e of improvement,
men would labour to become
virtuous, without being goaded on by
mi&#383;ery. But now, the per&#383;pective of
the golden age, fading before the attentive
eye of ob&#383;ervation, almo&#383;t eludes
my &#383;ight; and, lo&#383;ing thus in part my
theory of a more perfect &#383;tate, &#383;tart not,
my friend, if I bring forward an opinion,
which at the fir&#383;t glance &#383;eems to
be levelled again&#383;t the exi&#383;tence of God!
I am not become an Athei&#383;t, I a&#383;&#383;ure
you, by re&#383;iding at Paris: yet I begin
to fear that vice, or, if you will, evil,
is the grand mobile of action, and that,
when the pa&#383;&#383;ions are ju&#383;tly poized, we
become harmle&#383;s, and in the &#383;ame proportion
u&#383;ele&#383;s.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-46_S" id="DPg_4-46_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-46.png">46</a>]</span>
The wants of rea&#383;on are very few;
and, were we to con&#383;ider di&#383;pa&#383;&#383;ionately
the real value of mo&#383;t things, we &#383;hould
probably re&#383;t &#383;ati&#383;fied with the &#383;imple
gratification of our phy&#383;ical nece&#383;&#383;ities,
and be content with negative goodne&#383;s:
for it is frequently, only that wanton,
the Imagination, with her artful
coquetry, who lures us forward, and
makes us run over a rough road, pu&#383;hing
a&#383;ide every ob&#383;tacle merely to catch
a di&#383;appointment.</p>

<p>The de&#383;ire al&#383;o of being u&#383;eful to
others, is continually damped by experience;
and, if the exertions of humanity
were not in &#383;ome mea&#383;ure their
own reward, who would endure mi&#383;ery,
or &#383;truggle with care, to make
&#383;ome people ungrateful, and others
idle?</p>

<p>You will call the&#383;e melancholy effu<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-47_S" id="DPg_4-47_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-47.png">47</a>]</span>&#383;ions,
and gue&#383;s that, fatigued by the
vivacity, which has all the bu&#383;tling
folly of childhood, without the innocence
which renders ignorance charming,
I am too &#383;evere in my &#383;trictures.
It may be &#383;o; and I am aware that the
good effects of the revolution will be
la&#383;t felt at Paris; where &#383;urely the &#383;oul
of Epicurus has long been at work to
root out the &#383;imple emotions of the
heart, which, being natural, are always
moral. Rendered cold and artificial
by the &#383;elfi&#383;h enjoyments of the &#383;en&#383;es,
which the government fo&#383;tered, is it
&#383;urpri&#383;ing that &#383;implicity of manners,
and &#383;inglene&#383;s of heart, rarely appear,
to recreate me with the wild odour of
nature, &#383;o pa&#383;&#383;ing &#383;weet?</p>

<p>Seeing how deep the fibres of mi&#383;chief
have &#383;hot, I &#383;ometimes a&#383;k, with a
doubting accent, Whether a nation can<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-48_S" id="DPg_4-48_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-48.png">48</a>]</span>
go back to the purity of manners which
has hitherto been maintained un&#383;ullied
only by the keen air of poverty, when,
ema&#383;culated by plea&#383;ure, the luxuries
of pro&#383;perity are become the wants of
nature? I cannot yet give up the hope,
that a fairer day is dawning on Europe,
though I mu&#383;t he&#383;itatingly ob&#383;erve, that
little is to be expected from the narrow
principle of commerce which &#383;eems
every where to be &#383;hoving a&#383;ide <i>the point
of honour</i> of the <i>noble&#383;&#383;e</i>. I can look beyond
the evils of the moment, and do
not expect muddied water to become
clear before it has had time to &#383;tand;
yet, even for the moment, it is the
mo&#383;t terrific of all &#383;ights, to &#383;ee men
vicious without warmth&mdash;to &#383;ee the
order that &#383;hould be the &#383;uper&#383;cription
of virtue, cultivated to give &#383;ecurity to
crimes which only thoughtle&#383;&#383;ne&#383;s could<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-49_S" id="DPg_4-49_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-49.png">49</a>]</span>
palliate. Di&#383;order is, in fact, the very
e&#383;&#383;ence of vice, though with the wild
wi&#383;hes of a corrupt fancy humane emotions
often kindly mix to &#383;often their
atrocity. Thus humanity, genero&#383;ity,
and even &#383;elf-denial, &#383;ometimes render
a character grand, and even u&#383;eful,
when hurried away by lawle&#383;s pa&#383;&#383;ions;
but what can equal the turpitude of a
cold calculator who lives for him&#383;elf
alone, and con&#383;idering his fellow-creatures
merely as machines of plea&#383;ure,
never forgets that hone&#383;ty is the be&#383;t policy?
Keeping ever within the pale of
the law, he cru&#383;hes his thou&#383;ands with
impunity; but it is with that degree of
management, which makes him, to borrow
a &#383;ignificant vulgari&#383;m, a villain
<i>in grain</i>. The very exce&#383;s of his depravation
pre&#383;erves him, whil&#383;t the more
re&#383;pectable bea&#383;t of prey, who prowls<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-50_S" id="DPg_4-50_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-50.png">50</a>]</span>
about like the lion, and roars to announce
his approach, falls into a &#383;nare.</p>

<p>You may think it too &#383;oon to form
an opinion of the future government,
yet it is impo&#383;&#383;ible to avoid hazarding
&#383;ome conjectures, when every thing
whi&#383;pers me, that names, not principles,
are changed, and when I &#383;ee that
the turn of the tide has left the dregs of
the old &#383;y&#383;tem to corrupt the new. For
the &#383;ame pride of office, the &#383;ame de&#383;ire
of power are &#383;till vi&#383;ible; with this aggravation,
that, fearing to return to ob&#383;curity
after having but ju&#383;t acquired
a reli&#383;h for di&#383;tinction, each hero, or
philo&#383;opher, for all are dubbed with
the&#383;e new titles, endeavours to make
hay while the &#383;un &#383;hines; and every
petty municipal officer, become the idol,
or rather the tyrant of the day, &#383;talks
like a cock on a dunghil.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-51_S" id="DPg_4-51_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-51.png">51</a>]</span>
I &#383;hall now conclude this de&#383;ultory
letter; which however will enable you
to fore&#383;ee that I &#383;hall treat more of
morals than manners.</p>

<h2>LETTERS</h2>
<h3>ON THE</h3>
<h2>MANAGEMENT OF INFANTS.</h2>

<hr />

<h4>LETTER I</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">I ought</span> to apologize for not having
written to you on the &#383;ubject you
mentioned; but, to tell you the truth,
it grew upon me: and, in&#383;tead of an
an&#383;wer, I have begun a &#383;eries of letters
on the management of children in
their infancy. Replying then to your
que&#383;tion, I have the public in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-56_S" id="DPg_4-56_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-56.png">56</a>]</span>
thoughts, and &#383;hall endeavour to &#383;how
what modes appear to me nece&#383;&#383;ary,
to render the infancy of children more
healthy and happy. I have long
thought, that the cau&#383;e which renders
children as hard to rear as the mo&#383;t
fragile plant, is our deviation from
&#383;implicity. I know that &#383;ome able
phy&#383;icians have recommended the method
I have pur&#383;ued, and I mean to
point out the good effects I have ob&#383;erved
in practice. I am aware that
many matrons will exclaim again&#383;t me,
and dwell on the number of children
they have brought up, as their mothers
did before them, without troubling
them&#383;elves with new-fangled notions;
yet, though, in my uncle Toby's words,
they &#383;hould attempt to &#383;ilence me, by
"wi&#383;hing I had &#383;een their large" families,
I mu&#383;t &#383;uppo&#383;e, while a third part<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-57_S" id="DPg_4-57_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-57.png">57</a>]</span>
of the human &#383;pecies, according to the
mo&#383;t accurate calculation, die during
their infancy, ju&#383;t at the thre&#383;hold of
life, that there is &#383;ome error in the
modes adopted by mothers and nur&#383;es,
which counteracts their own endeavours.
I may be mi&#383;taken in &#383;ome
particulars; for general rules, founded
on the &#383;ounde&#383;t rea&#383;on, demand individual
modification; but, if I can per&#383;uade
any of the ri&#383;ing generation to
exerci&#383;e their rea&#383;on on this head, I am
content. My advice will probably
be found mo&#383;t u&#383;eful to mothers in the
middle cla&#383;s; and it is from them that
the lower imperceptibly gains improvement.
Cu&#383;tom, produced by rea&#383;on
in one, may &#383;afely be the effect of
imitation in the other.</p>

<h4>LETTER I</h4>

<p class="right">Dublin, April 14, [1787.]</p>

<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; Dear &#383;ir,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> &#383;till an invalid&mdash;and begin to
believe that I ought never to expect to
enjoy health. My mind preys on my
body&mdash;and, when I endeavour to be
u&#383;eful, I grow too much intere&#383;ted for
my own peace. Confined almo&#383;t entirely
to the &#383;ociety of children, I am
anxiou&#383;ly &#383;olicitous for their future
welfare, and mortified beyond mea&#383;ure,<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-62_S" id="DPg_4-62_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-62.png">62</a>]</span>
when counteracted in my endeavours to
improve them.&mdash;I feel all a mother's
fears for the &#383;warm of little ones which
&#383;urround me, and ob&#383;erve di&#383;orders,
without having power to apply the
proper remedies. How can I be reconciled
to life, when it is always a
painful warfare, and when I am deprived
of all the plea&#383;ures I reli&#383;h?&mdash;I
allude to rational conver&#383;ations, and
dome&#383;tic affections. Here, alone, a
poor &#383;olitary individual in a &#383;trange
land, tied to one &#383;pot, and &#383;ubject to
the caprice of another, can I be contented?
I am de&#383;irous to convince you
that I have <i>&#383;ome</i> cau&#383;e for &#383;orrow&mdash;and
am not without rea&#383;on detached from
life. I &#383;hall hope to hear that you are
well, and am yours &#383;incerely</p>

<h4>LETTER II</h4>

<p class="right">Henley, Thur&#383;day, Sept 13.</p>

<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; My dear &#383;ir,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> I &#383;aw you, I have, literally
&#383;peaking, <i>enjoyed</i> &#383;olitude. My &#383;i&#383;ter
could not accompany me in my rambles;
I therefore wandered alone, by
the &#383;ide of the Thames, and in the
neighbouring beautiful fields and
plea&#383;ure grounds: the pro&#383;pects were
of &#383;uch a placid kind, I <i>caught</i> tranquillity
while I &#383;urveyed them&mdash;my mind
was <i>&#383;till</i>, though active. Were I to
give you an account how I have &#383;pent
my time, you would &#383;mile.&mdash;I found an
old French bible here, and amu&#383;ed
my&#383;elf with comparing it with our<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-64_S" id="DPg_4-64_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-64.png">64</a>]</span>
Engli&#383;h tran&#383;lation; then I would li&#383;ten
to the falling leaves, or ob&#383;erve the
various tints the autumn gave to
them&mdash;At other times, the &#383;inging of
a robin, or the noi&#383;e of a water-mill,
engaged my attention&mdash;partial attention&mdash;,
for I was, at the &#383;ame time
perhaps di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ing &#383;ome knotty point,
or &#383;traying from this <i>tiny</i> world to new
&#383;y&#383;tems. After the&#383;e excur&#383;ions, I returned
to the family meals, told the
children &#383;tories (they think me <i>va&#383;tly</i>
agreeable), and my &#383;i&#383;ter was amu&#383;ed.&mdash;Well,
will you allow me to call this
way of pa&#383;&#383;ing my days plea&#383;ant?</p>

<p>I was ju&#383;t going to mend my pen;
but I believe it will enable me to &#383;ay
all I have to add to this epi&#383;tle. Have
you yet heard of an habitation for me?
I often think of my new plan of life;
and, le&#383;t my &#383;i&#383;ter &#383;hould try to prevail<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-65_S" id="DPg_4-65_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-65.png">65</a>]</span>
on me to alter it, I have avoided mentioning
it to her. I am determined!&mdash;Your
&#383;ex generally laugh at female
determinations; but let me tell you,
I never yet re&#383;olved to do, any thing of
con&#383;equence, that I did not adhere re&#383;olutely
to it, till I had accompli&#383;hed
my purpo&#383;e, improbable as it might
have appeared to a more timid mind.
In the cour&#383;e of near nine-and-twenty
years, I have gathered &#383;ome experience,
and felt many <i>&#383;evere</i> di&#383;appointments&mdash;and
what is the amount? I long for a
little peace and <i>independence</i>! Every
obligation we receive from our fellow-creatures
is a new &#383;hackle, takes from
our native freedom, and deba&#383;es the
mind, makes us mere earthworms&mdash;I
am not fond of grovelling!</p>

<h4>LETTER III</h4>

<p class="right">Market Harborough, Sept. 20.</p>

<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; My dear &#383;ir,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> left me with three opulent
trade&#383;men; their conver&#383;ation was not
calculated to beguile the way, when
the &#383;able curtain concealed the beauties
of nature. I li&#383;tened to the tricks
of trade&mdash;and &#383;hrunk away, without
wi&#383;hing to grow rich; even the novelty
of the &#383;ubjects did not render them
plea&#383;ing; fond as I am of tracing the
pa&#383;&#383;ions in all their different forms&mdash;I
was not &#383;urpri&#383;ed by any glimp&#383;e of the
&#383;ublime, or beautiful&mdash;though one of
them imagined I would be a u&#383;eful partner
in a good <i>firm</i>. I was very much
fatigued, and have &#383;carcely recovered<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-67_S" id="DPg_4-67_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-67.png">67</a>]</span>
my&#383;elf. I do not expect to enjoy the
&#383;ame tranquil plea&#383;ures Henley afforded:
I meet with new objects to employ
my mind; but many painful emotions
are complicated with the reflections
they give ri&#383;e to.</p>

<p>I do not intend to enter on the <i>old</i>
topic, yet hope to hear from you&mdash;and
am yours, &amp;c.</p>

<h4>LETTER IV</h4>

<p class="right">Friday Night.</p>

<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; My dear &#383;ir,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> your remarks are generally
judicious&mdash;I cannot <i>now</i> concur with you,
I mean with re&#383;pect to the preface<a name="FNanchor_67-A_21_S" id="DFNanchor_67-A_21_S"></a><a href="#DFootnote_67-A_21_S" class="fnanchor">[67-A]</a>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-68_S" id="DPg_4-68_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-68.png">68</a>]</span>
and have not altered it. I hate the
u&#383;ual &#383;mooth way of exhibiting proud
humility. A general rule <i>only</i> extends
to the majority&mdash;and, believe me, the
few judicious parents who may peru&#383;e
my book, will not feel them&#383;elves hurt&mdash;and
the weak are too vain to mind what
is &#383;aid in a book intended for children.</p>

<p>I return you the Italian MS.&mdash;but
do not ha&#383;tily imagine that I am indolent.
I would not &#383;pare any labour to
do my duty&mdash;and, after the mo&#383;t laborious
day, that &#383;ingle thought would
&#383;olace me more than any plea&#383;ures the
&#383;en&#383;es could enjoy. I find I could not
tran&#383;late the MS. well. If it was not
a MS, I &#383;hould not be &#383;o ea&#383;ily intimidated;
but the hand, and errors in

I am to live to be old.&mdash;At any rate, I
may hear of the virtues I may not contemplate&mdash;and
my rea&#383;on may permit
me to love a female.&mdash;I now allude to

To &#383;ay the truth, I was never more di&#383;plea&#383;ed

<h4>LETTER VII</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> I am become a reviewer, I think
it right, in the way of bu&#383;ine&#383;s, to con&#383;ider
the &#383;ubject. You have alarmed
the editor of the Critical, as the adverti&#383;ement
prefixed to the Appendix<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-74_S" id="DPg_4-74_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-74.png">74</a>]</span>
plainly &#383;hows. The Critical appears
to me to be a timid, mean production,
and its &#383;ucce&#383;s is a reflection on the
ta&#383;te and judgment of the public; but,
as a body, who ever gave it credit for
much? The voice of the people is only
the voice of truth, when &#383;ome man of
abilities has had time to get fa&#383;t hold of
the <span class="smcap">great no&#383;e</span> of the mon&#383;ter. Of
cour&#383;e, local fame is generally a
clamour, and dies away. The Appendix
to the Monthly afforded me more
amu&#383;ement, though every article almo&#383;t
wants energy and a <i>cant</i> of virtue and
liberality is &#383;trewed over it; always
tame, and eager to pay court to e&#383;tabli&#383;hed
fame. The account of Necker
is one unvaried tone of admiration.
Surely men were born only to provide
for the &#383;u&#383;tenance of the body by enfeebling
the mind!</p>

plain terms, what I think. I have ever

a peculiar empha&#383;is&mdash;and, as a mere
acquaintance, you were rude and <i>cruel</i>,
to &#383;tep forward to in&#383;ult a woman,
who&#383;e conduct and mi&#383;fortunes demand
re&#383;pect. If my friend, Mr. John&#383;on,
had made the propo&#383;al&mdash;I &#383;hould have
been &#383;everely hurt&mdash;have thought him
unkind and unfeeling, but not <i>impertinent</i>.&mdash;The

would &#383;oon be over. I can bear any
thing but my own contempt.</p>

<p>In a few words, what I call an in&#383;ult,
is the bare &#383;uppo&#383;ition that I could for
a moment think of <i>pro&#383;tituting</i> my per&#383;on
for a maintenance; for in that point of
view does &#383;uch a marriage appear to

the ab&#383;tract, and never by words and

<h4>LETTER XVI</h4>

<p class="right">Paris, December 26, 1792.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I &#383;hould</span> immediately on the receipt
of your letter, my dear friend, have
thanked you for your punctuality, for it
highly gratified me, had I not wi&#383;hed
to wait till I could tell you that this
day was not &#383;tained with blood. Indeed
the prudent precautions taken by
the National Convention to prevent a
tumult, made me &#383;uppo&#383;e that the dogs
of faction would not dare to bark, much
le&#383;s to bite, however true to their &#383;cent;
and I was not mi&#383;taken; for the citizens,
who were all called out, are returning
home with compo&#383;ed counte<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-93_S" id="DPg_4-93_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-93.png">93</a>]</span>nances,
&#383;houldering their arms. About
nine o'clock this morning, the king
pa&#383;&#383;ed by my window, moving &#383;ilently
along (excepting now and then a few
&#383;trokes on the drum, which rendered
the &#383;tillne&#383;s more awful) through empty
&#383;treets, &#383;urrounded by the national guards,
who, clu&#383;tering round the carriage,
&#383;eemed to de&#383;erve their name. The
inhabitants flocked to their windows,
but the ca&#383;ements were all &#383;hut, not a
voice was heard, nor did I &#383;ee any
thing like an in&#383;ulting ge&#383;ture.&mdash;For
the fir&#383;t time &#383;ince I entered France,
I bowed to the maje&#383;ty of the people,
and re&#383;pected the propriety of behaviour
&#383;o perfectly in uni&#383;on with my own
feelings. I can &#383;carcely tell you why,
but an a&#383;&#383;ociation of ideas made the
tears flow in&#383;en&#383;ibly from my eyes,
when I &#383;aw Louis &#383;itting, with more<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-94_S" id="DPg_4-94_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-94.png">94</a>]</span>
dignity than I expected from his character,
in a hackney coach, going to
meet death, where &#383;o many of his race
have triumphed. My fancy in&#383;tantly
brought Louis XIV before me, entering
the capital with all his pomp, after
one of the victories mo&#383;t flattering to
his pride, only to &#383;ee the &#383;un&#383;hine of
pro&#383;perity over&#383;hadowed by the &#383;ublime
gloom of mi&#383;ery. I have been alone
ever &#383;ince; and, though my mind is
calm, I cannot di&#383;mi&#383;s the lively images
that have filled my imagination all the
day.&mdash;Nay, do not &#383;mile, but pity me;
for, once or twice, lifting my eyes from
the paper, I have &#383;een eyes glare
through a gla&#383;s-door oppo&#383;ite my chair
and bloody hands &#383;hook at me. Not
the di&#383;tant &#383;ound of a foot&#383;tep can I
hear.&mdash;My apartments are remote from
tho&#383;e of the &#383;ervants, the only per&#383;ons<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-95_S" id="DPg_4-95_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-95.png">95</a>]</span>

one folding door opening after another.&mdash;I
wi&#383;h I had even kept the cat with
me!&mdash;I want to &#383;ee &#383;omething alive;
death in &#383;o many frightful &#383;hapes has
taken hold of my fancy.&mdash;I am going to
bed&mdash;and, for the fir&#383;t time in my life, I
cannot put out the candle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ye</span> who expect con&#383;tancy where every
thing is changing, and peace in the
mid&#383;t of tumult, attend to the voice of
experience, and mark in time the foot&#383;teps
of di&#383;appointment, or life will be
lo&#383;t in de&#383;ultory wi&#383;hes, and death arrive
before the dawn of wi&#383;dom.</p>

<p>In a &#383;eque&#383;tered valley, &#383;urrounded by
rocky mountains that intercepted many
of the pa&#383;&#383;ing clouds, though &#383;unbeams
variegated their ample &#383;ides, lived a
&#383;age, to whom nature had unlocked<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-100_S" id="DPg_4-100_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-100.png">100</a>]</span>
her mo&#383;t hidden &#383;ecrets. His hollow
eyes, &#383;unk in their orbits, retired from
the view of vulgar objects, and turned
inwards, overleaped the boundary pre&#383;cribed
to human knowledge. Inten&#383;e
thinking during four&#383;core and ten years,
had whitened the &#383;cattered locks on
his head, which, like the &#383;ummit of
the di&#383;tant mountain, appeared to be
bound by an eternal fro&#383;t.</p>

<p>On the &#383;andy wa&#383;te behind the mountains,
the track of ferocious bea&#383;ts
might be traced, and &#383;ometimes the
mangled limbs which they left, attracted
a hovering flight of birds of prey. An
exten&#383;ive wood the &#383;age had forced to
rear its head in a &#383;oil by no means congenial,
and the firm trunks of the trees
&#383;eemed to frown with defiance on time;
though the &#383;poils of innumerable &#383;ummers
covered the roots, which re&#383;embled<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-101_S" id="DPg_4-101_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-101.png">101</a>]</span>
fangs; &#383;o clo&#383;ely did they cling to the
unfriendly &#383;and, where &#383;erpents hi&#383;&#383;ed,
and &#383;nakes, rolling out their va&#383;t folds,
inhaled the noxious vapours. The ravens
and owls who inhabited the &#383;olitude,
gave al&#383;o a thicker gloom to the
everla&#383;ting twilight, and the croaking
of the former a monotony, in uni&#383;on
with the gloom; whil&#383;t lions and tygers,
&#383;hunning even this faint &#383;emblance of
day, &#383;ought the dark caverns, and at
night, when they &#383;hook off &#383;leep, their
roaring would make the whole valley
re&#383;ound, confounded with the &#383;creechings
of the bird of night.</p>

<p>One mountain ro&#383;e &#383;ublime, towering
above all, on the craggy &#383;ides of which
a few &#383;ea-weeds grew, wa&#383;hed by the
ocean, that with tumultuous roar ru&#383;hed
to a&#383;&#383;ault, and even undermine, the
huge barrier that &#383;topped its progre&#383;s;<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-102_S" id="DPg_4-102_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-102.png">102</a>]</span>
and ever and anon a ponderous ma&#383;s,
loo&#383;ened from the cliff, to which it
&#383;carcely &#383;eemed to adhere, always threatening
to fall, fell into the flood, rebounding
as it fell, and the &#383;ound was re-echoed
from rock to rock. Look where
you would, all was without form, as
if nature, &#383;uddenly &#383;topping her hand,
had left chaos a retreat.</p>

<p>Clo&#383;e to the mo&#383;t remote &#383;ide of it
was the &#383;age's abode. It was a rude
hut, formed of &#383;tumps of trees and
matted twigs, to &#383;ecure him from the
inclemency of the weather; only through
&#383;mall apertures cro&#383;&#383;ed with ru&#383;hes, the
wind entered in wild murmurs, modulated
by the&#383;e ob&#383;tructions. A clear
&#383;pring broke out of the middle of the
adjacent rock, which, dropping &#383;lowly
into a cavity it had hollowed, &#383;oon
overflowed, and then ran, &#383;truggling to<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-103_S" id="DPg_4-103_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-103.png">103</a>]</span>
free it&#383;elf from the cumbrous fragments,
till, become a deep, &#383;ilent &#383;tream, it
e&#383;caped through reeds, and roots of
trees, who&#383;e bla&#383;ted tops overhung and
darkened the current.</p>

<p>One &#383;ide of the hut was &#383;upported by
the rock, and at midnight, when the
&#383;age &#383;truck the inclo&#383;ed part, it yawned
wide, and admitted him into a cavern in
the very bowels of the earth, where
never human foot before had trod; and
the various &#383;pirits, which inhabit the
different regions of nature, were here
obedient to his potent word. The cavern
had been formed by the great
inundation of waters, when the approach
of a comet forced them from
their &#383;ource; then, when the fountains
of the great deep were broken up,
a &#383;tream ru&#383;hed out of the centre of the
earth, where the &#383;pirits, who have lived<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-104_S" id="DPg_4-104_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-104.png">104</a>]</span>
on it, are confined to purify them&#383;elves
from the dro&#383;s contracted in their fir&#383;t
&#383;tage of exi&#383;tence; and it flowed in
black waves, for ever bubbling along
the cave, the extent of which had never
been explored. From the &#383;ides and
top, water di&#383;tilled, and, petrifying as
it fell, took fanta&#383;tic &#383;hapes, that &#383;oon
divided it into apartments, if &#383;o they
might be called. In the foam, a wearied
&#383;pirit would &#383;ometimes ri&#383;e, to catch
the mo&#383;t di&#383;tant glimp&#383;e of light, or
ta&#383;te the vagrant breeze, which the
yawning of the rock admitted, when
Sage&#383;tus, for that was the name of the
hoary &#383;age, entered. Some, who were
refined and almo&#383;t cleared from vicious
&#383;pots, he would allow to leave, for a limited
time, their dark pri&#383;on-hou&#383;e;
and, flying on the winds acro&#383;s the bleak
northern ocean, or ri&#383;ing in an exhala<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-105_S" id="DPg_4-105_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-105.png">105</a>]</span>tion
till they reached a &#383;un-beam, they
thus re-vi&#383;ited the haunts of men. The&#383;e
were the guardian angels, who in &#383;oft
whi&#383;pers re&#383;train the vicious, and animate
the wavering wretch who &#383;tands
&#383;u&#383;pended between virtue and vice.</p>

<p>Sage&#383;tus had &#383;pent a night in the cavern,
as he often did, and he left the
&#383;ilent ve&#383;tibule of the grave, ju&#383;t as the
&#383;un, emerging from the ocean, di&#383;per&#383;ed
the clouds, which were not half
&#383;o den&#383;e as tho&#383;e he had left. All that
was human in him rejoiced at the &#383;ight
of reviving life, and he viewed with
plea&#383;ure the mounting &#383;ap ri&#383;ing to expand
the herbs, which grew &#383;pontaneou&#383;ly
in this wild&mdash;when, turning his
eyes towards the &#383;ea, he found that
death had been at work during his ab&#383;ence,
and terrific marks of a furious
&#383;torm &#383;till &#383;pread horror around. Though<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-106_S" id="DPg_4-106_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-106.png">106</a>]</span>
the day was &#383;erene, and threw bright
rays on eyes for ever &#383;hut, it dawned
not for the wretches who hung pendent
on the craggy rocks, or were &#383;tretched
lifele&#383;s on the &#383;and. Some, &#383;truggling,
had dug them&#383;elves a grave; others
had re&#383;igned their breath before the
impetuous &#383;urge whirled them on &#383;hore.
A few, in whom the vital &#383;park was
not &#383;o &#383;oon di&#383;lodged, had clung to
loo&#383;e fragments; it was the gra&#383;p of
death; embracing the &#383;tone, they &#383;tiffened;
and the head, no longer erect,
re&#383;ted on the ma&#383;s which the arms encircled.
It felt not the agonizing gripe,
nor heard the &#383;igh that broke the heart
in twain.</p>

<p>Re&#383;ting his chin on an oaken club,
the &#383;age looked on every &#383;ide, to &#383;ee
if he could di&#383;cern any who yet breathed.
He drew nearer, and thought he<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-107_S" id="DPg_4-107_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-107.png">107</a>]</span>
&#383;aw, at the fir&#383;t glance, the unclo&#383;ed eyes
glare; but &#383;oon perceived that they
were a mere gla&#383;&#383;y &#383;ub&#383;tance, mute as
the tongue; the jaws were fallen, and,
in &#383;ome of the tangled locks, hands
were clinched; nay, even the nails
had entered &#383;harpened by de&#383;pair. The
blood flew rapidly to his heart; it was
fle&#383;h; he felt he was &#383;till a man, and
the big tear paced down his iron cheeks,
who&#383;e mu&#383;cles had not for a long time
been relaxed by &#383;uch humane emotions.
A moment he breathed quick, then
heaved a &#383;igh, and his wonted calm
returned with an unaccu&#383;tomed glow
of tenderne&#383;s; for the ways of heaven
were not hid from him; he lifted up
his eyes to the common Father of nature,
and all was as &#383;till in his bo&#383;om, as
the &#383;mooth deep, after having clo&#383;ed<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-108_S" id="DPg_4-108_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-108.png">108</a>]</span>
over the huge ve&#383;&#383;el from which the
wretches had fled.</p>

<p>Turning round a part of the rock
that jutted out, meditating on the ways
of Providence, a weak infantine voice
reached his ears; it was li&#383;ping out the
name of mother. He looked, and beheld
a blooming child leaning over, and
ki&#383;&#383;ing with eager fondne&#383;s, lips that
were in&#383;en&#383;ible to the warm pre&#383;&#383;ure.
Starting at the &#383;ight of the &#383;age, &#383;he
fixed her eyes on him, "Wake her,
ah! wake her," &#383;he cried, "or the
&#383;ea will catch us." Again he felt compa&#383;&#383;ion,
for he &#383;aw that the mother
&#383;lept the &#383;leep of death. He &#383;tretched
out his hand, and, &#383;moothing his brow,
invited her to approach; but &#383;he &#383;till
intreated him to wake her mother,
whom &#383;he continued to call, with an
impatient tremulous voice. To detach<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-109_S" id="DPg_4-109_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-109.png">109</a>]</span>
her from the body by per&#383;ua&#383;ion would
not have been very ea&#383;y. Sage&#383;tus had
a quicker method to effect his purpo&#383;e;
he took out a box which contained a
&#383;oporific powder, and as &#383;oon as the
fumes reached her brain, the powers of
life were &#383;u&#383;pended.</p>

<p>He carried her directly to his hut,
and left her &#383;leeping profoundly on his
ru&#383;hy couch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Again</span> Sage&#383;tus approached the
dead, to view them with a more &#383;crutinizing
eye. He was perfectly acquainted
with the con&#383;truction of the
human body, knew the traces that virtue
or vice leaves on the whole frame;
they were now indelibly fixed by death;
nay more, he knew by the &#383;hape of
the &#383;olid &#383;tructure, how far the &#383;pirit
could range, and &#383;aw the barrier beyond
which it could not pa&#383;s: the mazes of
fancy he explored, mea&#383;ured the &#383;tretch

By their appearance, at a tran&#383;ient
glance, he knew that the ve&#383;&#383;el mu&#383;t
have contained many pa&#383;&#383;engers, and
that &#383;ome of them were above the vulgar,
with re&#383;pect to fortune and education;
he then walked lei&#383;urely among
the dead, and narrowly ob&#383;erved their
pallid features.</p>

<p>His eye fir&#383;t re&#383;ted on a form in which
proportion reigned, and, &#383;troking back
the hair, a &#383;pacious forehead met his
view; warm fancy had revelled there,
and her airy dance had left ve&#383;tiges,
&#383;carcely vi&#383;ible to a mortal eye. Some
perpendicular lines pointed out that
melancholy had predominated in his
con&#383;titution; yet the &#383;traggling hairs
of his eye-brows &#383;howed that anger had
often &#383;hook his frame; indeed, the
four temperatures, like the four elements,
had re&#383;ided in this little world,<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-112_S" id="DPg_4-112_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-112.png">112</a>]</span>
and produced harmony. The whole
vi&#383;age was bony, and an energetic
frown had knit the flexible &#383;kin of his
brow; the kingdom within had been
exten&#383;ive; and the wild creations of
fancy had there "a local habitation
and a name." So exqui&#383;ite was his
&#383;en&#383;ibility, &#383;o quick his comprehen&#383;ion,
that he perceived various combinations
in an in&#383;tant; he caught truth as &#383;he
darted towards him, &#383;aw all her fair
proportion at a glance, and the fla&#383;h of
his eye &#383;poke the quick &#383;en&#383;es which
conveyed intelligence to his mind; the
&#383;en&#383;orium indeed was capacious, and
the &#383;age imagined he &#383;aw the lucid
beam, &#383;parkling with love or ambition,
in characters of fire, which a graceful
curve of the upper eyelid &#383;haded. The
lips were a little deranged by contempt;
and a mixture of vanity and<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-113_S" id="DPg_4-113_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-113.png">113</a>]</span>
&#383;elf-complacency formed a few irregular
lines round them. The chin had
&#383;uffered from &#383;en&#383;uality, yet there were
&#383;till great marks of vigour in it, as if
advanced with &#383;tern dignity. The
hand accu&#383;tomed to command, and even
tyrannize, was unnerved; but its appearance
convinced Sage&#383;tus, that he
had oftener wielded a thought than a
weapon; and that he had &#383;ilenced, by
irre&#383;i&#383;tible conviction, the &#383;uperficial
di&#383;putant, and the being, who doubted
becau&#383;e he had not &#383;trength to believe,
who, wavering between different borrowed
opinions, fir&#383;t caught at one
&#383;traw, then at another, unable to &#383;ettle
into any con&#383;i&#383;tency of character. After
gazing a few moments, Sage&#383;tus turned
away exclaiming, How are the &#383;tately
oaks torn up by a tempe&#383;t, and the bow<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-114_S" id="DPg_4-114_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-114.png">114</a>]</span>
un&#383;trung, that could force the arrow
beyond the ken of the eye!</p>

<p>What a different face next met his
view! The forehead was &#383;hort, yet well
&#383;et together; the no&#383;e &#383;mall, but a little
turned up at the end; and a draw-down
at the &#383;ides of his mouth, proved that
he had been a humouri&#383;t, who minded
the main chance, and could joke with
his acquaintance, while he eagerly devoured
a dainty which he was not to
pay for. His lips &#383;hut like a box who&#383;e
hinges had often been mended; and
the mu&#383;cles, which di&#383;play the &#383;oft emotion
of the heart on the cheeks, were
grown quite rigid, &#383;o that, the ve&#383;&#383;els
that &#383;hould have moi&#383;tened them not
having much communication with the
grand &#383;ource of pa&#383;&#383;ions, the fine volatile
fluid had evaporated, and they
became mere dry fibres, which might<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-115_S" id="DPg_4-115_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-115.png">115</a>]</span>
be pulled by any mi&#383;fortune that
threatened him&#383;elf, but were not &#383;ufficiently
ela&#383;tic to be moved by the
mi&#383;eries of others. His joints were
in&#383;erted compactly, and with celerity
they had performed all the animal
functions, without any of the grace
which re&#383;ults from the imagination
mixing with the &#383;en&#383;es.</p>

<p>A huge form was &#383;tretched near him,
that exhibited marks of overgrown
infancy; every part was relaxed; all
appeared imperfect. Yet, &#383;ome undulating
lines on the puffed-out cheeks,
di&#383;played &#383;igns of timid, &#383;ervile good
nature; and the &#383;kin of the forehead
had been &#383;o often drawn up by wonder,
that the few hairs of the eyebrows were
fixed in a &#383;harp arch, whil&#383;t an ample
chin re&#383;ted in lobes of fle&#383;h on his protuberant
brea&#383;t.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-116_S" id="DPg_4-116_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-116.png">116</a>]</span>
By his &#383;ide was a body that had
&#383;carcely ever much life in it&mdash;&#383;ympathy
&#383;eemed to have drawn them together&mdash;every
feature and limb was round and
fle&#383;hy, and, if a kind of brutal cunning
had not marked the face, it might have
been mi&#383;taken for an automaton, &#383;o unmixed
was the phlegmatic fluid. The
vital &#383;park was buried deep in a &#383;oft
ma&#383;s of matter, re&#383;embling the pith in
young elder, which, when found, is &#383;o
equivocal, that it only appears a moi&#383;ter
part of the &#383;ame body.</p>

<p>Another part of the beach was
covered with &#383;ailors, who&#383;e bodies exhibited
marks of &#383;trength and brutal
courage.&mdash;Their characters were all
different, though of the &#383;ame cla&#383;s;
Sage&#383;tus did not &#383;tay to di&#383;criminate
them, &#383;ati&#383;fied with a rough &#383;ketch.
He &#383;aw indolence rou&#383;ed by a love of<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-117_S" id="DPg_4-117_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-117.png">117</a>]</span>
humour, or rather bodily fun; &#383;en&#383;uality
and prodigality with a vein of genero&#383;ity
running through it; a contempt
of danger with gro&#383;s &#383;uper&#383;tition;
&#383;upine &#383;en&#383;es, only to be kept alive by
noi&#383;y, tumultuous plea&#383;ures, or that
kind of novelty which borders on ab&#383;urdity:
this formed the common outline,
and the re&#383;t were rather dabs than
&#383;hades.</p>

<p>Sage&#383;tus pau&#383;ed, and remembered it
had been &#383;aid by an earthly wit, that
"many a flower is born to blu&#383;h un&#383;een,
and wa&#383;te its &#383;weetne&#383;s on the
de&#383;art air." How little, he exclaimed,
did that poet know of the ways of
heaven! And yet, in this re&#383;pect, they
are direct; the hands before me, were
de&#383;igned to pull a rope, knock down a
&#383;heep, or perform the &#383;ervile offices of
life; no "mute, inglorious poet" re&#383;ts<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-118_S" id="DPg_4-118_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-118.png">118</a>]</span>
among&#383;t them, and he who is &#383;uperior
to his fellow, does not ri&#383;e above mediocrity.
The genius that &#383;prouts from
a dunghil &#383;oon &#383;hakes off the heterogenous
ma&#383;s; tho&#383;e only grovel, who
have not power to fly.</p>

<p>He turned his &#383;tep towards the mother
of the orphan: another female
was at &#383;ome di&#383;tance; and a man who,
by his garb, might have been the hu&#383;band,
or brother, of the former, was
not far off.</p>

<p>Him the &#383;age &#383;urveyed with an attentive
eye, and bowed with re&#383;pect
to the inanimate clay, that lately had
been the dwelling of a mo&#383;t benevolent
&#383;pirit. The head was &#383;quare, though
the features were not very prominent;
but there was a great harmony in every
part, and the turn of the no&#383;trils and
lips evinced, that the &#383;oul mu&#383;t have<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-119_S" id="DPg_4-119_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-119.png">119</a>]</span>
had ta&#383;te, to which they had &#383;erved as
organs. Penetration and judgment
were &#383;eated on the brows that overhung
the eye. Fixed as it was, Sage&#383;tus
quickly di&#383;cerned the expre&#383;&#383;ion
it mu&#383;t have had; dark and pen&#383;ive,
rather from &#383;lowne&#383;s of comprehen&#383;ion
than melancholy, it &#383;eemed to ab&#383;orb
the light of knowledge, to drink it in
ray by ray; nay, a new one was not
allowed to enter his head till the la&#383;t
was arranged: an opinion was thus
cautiou&#383;ly received, and maturely
weighed, before it was added to the
general &#383;tock. As nature led him to
mount from a part to the whole, he
was mo&#383;t conver&#383;ant with the beautiful,
and rarely comprehended the &#383;ublime;
yet, &#383;aid Sage&#383;tus, with a &#383;oftened tone,
he was all heart, full of forbearance, and
de&#383;irous to plea&#383;e every fellow-creature;<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-120_S" id="DPg_4-120_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-120.png">120</a>]</span>
but from a nobler motive than a love
of admiration; the fumes of vanity
never mounted to cloud his brain, or
tarni&#383;h his beneficence. The fluid in
which tho&#383;e placid eyes &#383;wam, is now
congealed; how often has tenderne&#383;s
given them the fine&#383;t water! Some
torn parts of the child's dre&#383;s hung
round his arm, which led the &#383;age to
conclude, that he had &#383;aved the child;
every line in his face confirmed the
conjecture; benevolence indeed &#383;trung
the nerves that naturally were not
very firm; it was the great knot that
tied together the &#383;cattered qualities,
and gave the di&#383;tinct &#383;tamp to the character.</p>

<p>The female whom he next approached,
and &#383;uppo&#383;ed to be an attendant on
the other, was below the middle &#383;ize,
and her legs were &#383;o di&#383;proportionably<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-121_S" id="DPg_4-121_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-121.png">121</a>]</span>
&#383;hort, that, when &#383;he moved, &#383;he mu&#383;t
have waddled along; her elbows were
drawn in to touch her long taper, wai&#383;t,
and the air of her whole body was an
affectation of gentility. Death could
not alter the rigid hang of her limbs, or
efface the &#383;imper that had &#383;tretched her
mouth; the lips were thin, as if nature
intended &#383;he &#383;hould mince her words;
her no&#383;e was &#383;mall, and &#383;harp at the
end; and the forehead, unmarked by
eyebrows, was wrinkled by the di&#383;content
that had &#383;unk her cheeks, on
which Sage&#383;tus &#383;till di&#383;cerned faint
traces of tenderne&#383;s; and fierce good-nature,
he perceived had &#383;ometimes
animated the little &#383;park of an eye that
anger had oftener lighted. The &#383;ame
thought occurred to him that the &#383;ight
of the &#383;ailors had &#383;ugge&#383;ted, Men and
women are all in their proper places<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-122_S" id="DPg_4-122_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-122.png">122</a>]</span>&mdash;this
female was intended to fold up
linen and nur&#383;e the &#383;ick.</p>

<p>Anxious to ob&#383;erve the mother of
his charge, he turned to the lily that
had been &#383;o rudely &#383;napped, and, carefully
ob&#383;erving it, traced every fine line
to its &#383;ource. There was a delicacy in
her form, &#383;o truly feminine, that an involuntary
de&#383;ire to cheri&#383;h &#383;uch a being,
made the &#383;age again feel the almo&#383;t forgotten
&#383;en&#383;ations of his nature. On
ob&#383;erving her more clo&#383;ely, he di&#383;covered
that her natural delicacy had been
increa&#383;ed by an improper education,
to a degree that took away all vigour
from her faculties. And its baneful
influence had had &#383;uch an effect on her
mind, that few traces of the exertions
of it appeared on her face, though the
fine fini&#383;h of her features, and particularly
the form of the forehead, con<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-123_S" id="DPg_4-123_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-123.png">123</a>]</span>vinced
the &#383;age that her under&#383;tanding
might have ri&#383;en con&#383;iderably above
mediocrity, had the wheels ever been
put in motion; but, clogged by prejudices,
they never turned quite round,
and, whenever &#383;he con&#383;idered a &#383;ubject,
&#383;he &#383;topped before &#383;he came to a conclu&#383;ion.
A&#383;&#383;uming a ma&#383;k of propriety,
&#383;he had bani&#383;hed nature; yet
its tendency was only to be diverted,
not &#383;tifled. Some lines, which took
from the &#383;ymmetry of the mouth, not
very obvious to a &#383;uperficial ob&#383;erver,
&#383;truck Sage&#383;tus, and they appeared to
him characters of indolent ob&#383;tinacy.
Not having courage to form an opinion
of her own, &#383;he adhered, with blind
partiality, to tho&#383;e &#383;he adopted, which
&#383;he received in the lump, and, as they
always remained unopened, of cour&#383;e
&#383;he only &#383;aw the even glo&#383;s on the out<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-124_S" id="DPg_4-124_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-124.png">124</a>]</span>&#383;ide.
Ve&#383;tiges of anger were vi&#383;ible on
her brow, and the &#383;age concluded, that
&#383;he had often been offended with, and
indeed would &#383;carcely make any allowance
for, tho&#383;e who did not coincide
with her in opinion, as things always
appear &#383;elf-evident that have never
been examined; yet her very weakne&#383;s
gave a charming timidity to her countenance;
goodne&#383;s and tenderne&#383;s pervaded
every lineament, and melted in
her dark blue eyes. The compa&#383;&#383;ion
that wanted activity, was &#383;incere, though
it only embelli&#383;hed her face, or produced
ca&#383;ual acts of charity when a
moderate alms could relieve pre&#383;ent
di&#383;tre&#383;s. Unacquainted with life, fictitious,
unnatural di&#383;tre&#383;s drew the tears
that were not &#383;hed for real mi&#383;ery. In
its own &#383;hape, human wretchedne&#383;s
excites a little di&#383;gu&#383;t in the mind that<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-125_S" id="DPg_4-125_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-125.png">125</a>]</span>
has indulged &#383;ickly refinement. Perhaps
the &#383;age gave way to a little conjecture
in drawing the la&#383;t conclu&#383;ion;
but his conjectures generally aro&#383;e from
di&#383;tinct ideas, and a dawn of light
allowed him to &#383;ee a great way farther
than common mortals.</p>

<p>He was now convinced that the orphan
was not very unfortunate in having
lo&#383;t &#383;uch a mother. The parent that
in&#383;pires fond affection without re&#383;pect,
is &#383;eldom an u&#383;eful one; and they only
are re&#383;pectable, who con&#383;ider right and
wrong ab&#383;tracted from local forms and
accidental modifications.</p>

<p>Determined to adopt the child, he
named it after him&#383;elf, Sage&#383;ta, and
retired to the hut where the innocent
&#383;lept, to think of the be&#383;t method of
educating this child, whom the angry
deep had &#383;pared.</p>

particularly &#383;truck and intere&#383;ted Sage&#383;ta.
The &#383;age, ob&#383;erving what pa&#383;&#383;ed in her
mind, bade her ever tru&#383;t to the fir&#383;t
impre&#383;&#383;ion. In life, he continued, try
to remember the effect the fir&#383;t appearance
of a &#383;tranger has on your mind;
and, in proportion to your &#383;en&#383;ibility,
you may decide on the character. Intelligence
glances from eyes that have
the &#383;ame pur&#383;uits, and a benevolent
heart &#383;oon traces the marks of benevolence
on the countenance of an unknown
fellow-creature; and not only
the countenance, but the ge&#383;tures, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-128_S" id="DPg_4-128_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-128.png">128</a>]</span>
voice, loudly &#383;peak truth to the unprejudiced
mind.</p>

<p>Whenever a &#383;tranger advances towards
you with a tripping &#383;tep, receives
you with broad &#383;miles, and a profu&#383;ion
of compliments, and yet you find your&#383;elf
embarra&#383;&#383;ed and unable to return
the &#383;alutation with equal cordiality, be
a&#383;&#383;ured that &#383;uch a per&#383;on is affected,
and endeavours to maintain a very good
character in the eyes of the world,
without really practi&#383;ing the &#383;ocial virtues
which dre&#383;s the face in looks of
unfeigned complacency. Kindred minds
are drawn to each other by expre&#383;&#383;ions
which elude de&#383;cription; and, like the
calm breeze that plays on a &#383;mooth
lake, they are rather felt than &#383;een.
Beware of a man who always appears in
good humour; a &#383;elfi&#383;h de&#383;ign too frequently
lurks in the &#383;miles the heart<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-129_S" id="DPg_4-129_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-129.png">129</a>]</span>
never curved; or there is an affectation
of candour that de&#383;troys all &#383;trength of
character, by blending truth and fal&#383;hood
into an unmeaning ma&#383;s. The
mouth, in fact, &#383;eems to be the feature
where you may trace every kind of di&#383;&#383;imulation,
from the &#383;imper of vanity,
to the fixed &#383;mile of the de&#383;igning villain.
Perhaps, the modulations of
the voice will &#383;till more quickly give
a key to the character than even the
turns of the mouth, or the words
that i&#383;&#383;ue from it; often do the
tones of unpracti&#383;ed di&#383;&#383;emblers give
the lie to their a&#383;&#383;ertions. Many
people never &#383;peak in an unnatural
voice, but when they are in&#383;incere: the
phra&#383;es not corre&#383;ponding with the
dictates of the heart, have nothing to
keep them in tune. In the cour&#383;e of
an argument however, you may ea&#383;ily

concurred in opinion with her,
ob&#383;erving that the &#383;en&#383;es of children
&#383;hould be the fir&#383;t object of improvement;
then their pa&#383;&#383;ions worked on; and judgment
the fruit, mu&#383;t be the acquirement
of the being it&#383;elf, when out of
leading-&#383;trings. The &#383;pirit bowed a&#383;&#383;ent,
and, without any further prelude,
entered on her hi&#383;tory.</p>

<p>My mother was a mo&#383;t re&#383;pectable
character, but &#383;he was yoked to a man
who&#383;e follies and vices made her ever
feel the weight of her chains. The
fir&#383;t &#383;en&#383;ation I recollect, was pity; for
I have &#383;een her weep over me and the
re&#383;t of her babes, lamenting that the
extravagance of a father would throw
us de&#383;titute on the world. But, though
my father was extravagant, and &#383;eldom<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-132_S" id="DPg_4-132_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-132.png">132</a>]</span>
thought of any thing but his own plea&#383;ures,
our education was not neglected.
In &#383;olitude, this employment was my
mother's only &#383;olace; and my father's
pride made him procure us ma&#383;ters;
nay, &#383;ometimes he was &#383;o gratified by
our improvement, that he would embrace
us with tenderne&#383;s, and intreat
my mother to forgive him, with marks
of real contrition. But the affection his
penitence gave ri&#383;e to, only &#383;erved to
expo&#383;e her to continual di&#383;appointments,
and keep hope alive merely to
torment her. After a violent debauch
he would let his beard grow, and the
&#383;adne&#383;s that reigned in the hou&#383;e I &#383;hall
never forget; he was a&#383;hamed to meet
even the eyes of his children. This is &#383;o
contrary to the nature of things, it
gave me exqui&#383;ite pain; I u&#383;ed, at tho&#383;e
times, to &#383;how him extreme re&#383;pect. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-133_S" id="DPg_4-133_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-133.png">133</a>]</span>
could not bear to &#383;ee my parent humble
him&#383;elf before me. However neither
his con&#383;titution, nor fortune could
long bear the con&#383;tant wa&#383;te. He had,
I have ob&#383;erved, a childi&#383;h affection
for his children, which was di&#383;played
in care&#383;&#383;es that gratified him for the
moment, yet never re&#383;trained the headlong
fury of his appetites; his momentary
repentance wrung his heart, without
influencing his conduct; and he died,
leaving an encumbered wreck of a good
e&#383;tate.</p>

<p>As we had always lived in &#383;plendid
poverty, rather than in affluence, the
&#383;hock was not &#383;o great; and my mother
repre&#383;&#383;ed her angui&#383;h, and concealed
&#383;ome circum&#383;tances, that &#383;he might not
&#383;hed a de&#383;tructive mildew over the
gaiety of youth.</p>

<p>So fondly did I doat on this dear pa<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-134_S" id="DPg_4-134_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-134.png">134</a>]</span>rent,
that &#383;he engro&#383;&#383;ed all my tenderne&#383;s;
her &#383;orrows had knit me firmly to
her, and my chief care was to give her
proofs of affection. The gallantry that
afforded my companions, the few young
people my mother forced me to mix
with, &#383;o much plea&#383;ure, I de&#383;pi&#383;ed; I
wi&#383;hed more to be loved than admired,
for I could love. I adored virtue; and
my imagination, cha&#383;ing a chimerical
object, overlooked the common plea&#383;ures
of life; they were not &#383;ufficient for my
happine&#383;s. A latent fire made me burn
to ri&#383;e &#383;uperior to my contemporaries in
wi&#383;dom and virtue; and tears of joy
and emulation filled my eyes when I
read an account of a great action&mdash;I
felt admiration, not a&#383;toni&#383;hment.</p>

<p>My mother had two particular friends,
who endeavoured to &#383;ettle her affairs;
one was a middle-aged man, a mer<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-135_S" id="DPg_4-135_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-135.png">135</a>]</span>chant;
the human brea&#383;t never en&#383;hrined
a more benevolent heart. His
manners were rather rough, and he
bluntly &#383;poke his thoughts without ob&#383;erving
the pain it gave; yet he po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed
extreme tenderne&#383;s, as far as his di&#383;cernment
went. Men do not make
&#383;ufficient di&#383;tinction, &#383;aid &#383;he, digre&#383;&#383;ing
from her &#383;tory to addre&#383;s Sage&#383;tus, between
tenderne&#383;s and &#383;en&#383;ibility.</p>

<p>To give the &#383;horte&#383;t definition of &#383;en&#383;ibility,
replied the &#383;age, I &#383;hould &#383;ay
that it is the re&#383;ult of acute &#383;en&#383;es, finely
fa&#383;hioned nerves, which vibrate at the
&#383;lighte&#383;t touch, and convey &#383;uch clear intelligence
to the brain, that it does not
require to be arranged by the judgment.
Such per&#383;ons in&#383;tantly enter into the
characters of others, and in&#383;tinctively
di&#383;cern what will give pain to every
human being; their own feelings are<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-136_S" id="DPg_4-136_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-136.png">136</a>]</span>
&#383;o varied that they &#383;eem to contain in
them&#383;elves, not only all the pa&#383;&#383;ions of the
&#383;pecies, but their various modifications.
Exqui&#383;ite pain and plea&#383;ure is their
portion; nature wears for them a different
a&#383;pect than is di&#383;played to common
mortals. One moment it is a paradi&#383;e;
all is beautiful: a cloud ari&#383;es, an emotion
receives a &#383;udden damp; darkne&#383;s
invades the &#383;ky, and the world is an
unweeded garden;&mdash;but go on with
your narrative, &#383;aid Sage&#383;tus, recollecting
him&#383;elf.</p>

<p>She proceeded. The man I am de&#383;cribing
was humanity it&#383;elf; but frequently
he did not under&#383;tand me; many of my
feelings were not to be analyzed by
his common &#383;en&#383;e. His friend&#383;hips,
for he had many friends, gave him plea&#383;ure
unmixed with pain; his religion
was coldly rea&#383;onable, becau&#383;e he want<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-137_S" id="DPg_4-137_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-137.png">137</a>]</span>ed
fancy, and he did not feel the nece&#383;&#383;ity
of finding, or creating, a perfect
object, to an&#383;wer the one engraved on
his heart: the &#383;ketch there was faint.
He went with the &#383;tream, and rather
caught a character from the &#383;ociety he
lived in, than &#383;pread one around him.
In my mind many opinions were graven
with a pen of bra&#383;s, which he thought
chimerical: but time could not era&#383;e
them, and I now recognize them as
the &#383;eeds of eternal happine&#383;s: they
will &#383;oon expand in tho&#383;e realms where
I &#383;hall enjoy the bli&#383;s adapted to my
nature; this is all we need a&#383;k of the
Supreme Being; happine&#383;s mu&#383;t follow
the completion of his de&#383;igns. He
however could live quietly, without
giving a preponderancy to many important
opinions that continually obtruded
on my mind; not having an en<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-138_S" id="DPg_4-138_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-138.png">138</a>]</span>thu&#383;ia&#383;tic
affection for his fellow creatures,
he did them good, without &#383;uffering
from their follies. He was particularly
attached to me, and I felt for
him all the affection of a daughter;
often, when he had been intere&#383;ting
him&#383;elf to promote my welfare, have I
lamented that he was not my father;
lamented that the vices of mine had
dried up one &#383;ource of pure affection.</p>

<p>The other friend I have already alluded
to, was of a very different character;
greatne&#383;s of mind, and tho&#383;e
combinations of feeling which are &#383;o
difficult to de&#383;cribe, rai&#383;ed him above
the throng, that bu&#383;tle their hour out,
lie down to &#383;leep, and are forgotten.
But I &#383;hall &#383;oon &#383;ee him, &#383;he exclaimed,
as much &#383;uperior to his former &#383;elf, as
he then ro&#383;e in my eyes above his fellow
creatures! As &#383;he &#383;poke, a glow<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-139_S" id="DPg_4-139_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-139.png">139</a>]</span>
of delight animated each feature; her
countenance appeared tran&#383;parent; and
&#383;he &#383;ilently anticipated the happine&#383;s
&#383;he &#383;hould enjoy, when &#383;he entered tho&#383;e
man&#383;ions, where death-divided friends
&#383;hould meet, to part no more; where
human weakne&#383;s could not damp their
bli&#383;s, or poi&#383;on the cup of joy that, on
earth, drops from the lips as &#383;oon as
ta&#383;ted, or, if &#383;ome daring mortal &#383;natches
a ha&#383;ty draught, what was &#383;weet to the
ta&#383;te becomes a root of bitterne&#383;s.</p>

<p>He was unfortunate, had many cares
to &#383;truggle with, and I marked on his
cheeks traces of the &#383;ame &#383;orrows that
&#383;unk my own. He was unhappy I &#383;ay,
and perhaps pity might fir&#383;t have awoke
my tenderne&#383;s; for, early in life, an
artful woman worked on his compa&#383;&#383;ionate
&#383;oul, and he united his fate to
a being made up of &#383;uch jarring ele<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-140_S" id="DPg_4-140_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-140.png">140</a>]</span>ments,
that he was &#383;till alone. The
di&#383;covery did not extingui&#383;h that propen&#383;ity
to love, a high &#383;en&#383;e of virtue
fed. I &#383;aw him &#383;ick and unhappy,
without a friend to &#383;ooth the hours
languor made heavy; often did I &#383;it a
long winter's evening by his &#383;ide, railing
at the &#383;wift wings of time, and
terming my love, humanity.</p>

<p>Two years pa&#383;&#383;ed in this manner, &#383;ilently
rooting my affection; and it might
have continued calm, if a fever had
not brought him to the very verge of
the grave. Though &#383;till deceived, I was
mi&#383;erable that the cu&#383;toms of the world
did not allow me to watch by him;
when &#383;leep for&#383;ook his pillow, my wearied
eyes were not clo&#383;ed, and my
anxious &#383;pirit hovered round his bed.
I &#383;aw him, before he had recovered his
&#383;trength; and, when his hand touched<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-141_S" id="DPg_4-141_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-141.png">141</a>]</span>
mine, life almo&#383;t retired, or flew to
meet the touch. The fir&#383;t look found
a ready way to my heart, and thrilled
through every vein. We were left
alone, and in&#383;en&#383;ibly began to talk of
the immortality of the &#383;oul; I declared
that I could not live without this conviction.
In the ardour of conver&#383;ation
he pre&#383;&#383;ed my hand to his heart; it
re&#383;ted there a moment, and my emotions
gave weight to my opinion, for
the affection we felt was not of a peri&#383;hable
nature.&mdash;A &#383;ilence en&#383;ued, I
know not how long; he then threw
my hand from him, as if it had been a
&#383;erpent; formally complained of the
weather, and adverted to twenty other
unintere&#383;ting &#383;ubjects. Vain efforts!
Our hearts had already &#383;poken to
each other.</p>

<p>Feebly did I afterwards combat an<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-142_S" id="DPg_4-142_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-142.png">142</a>]</span>
affection, which &#383;eemed twi&#383;ted in every
fibre of my heart. The world &#383;tood &#383;till
when I thought of him; it moved heavily
at be&#383;t, with one who&#383;e very con&#383;titution
&#383;eemed to mark her out for mi&#383;ery.
But I will not dwell on the pa&#383;&#383;ion
I too fondly nur&#383;ed. One only refuge
had I on earth; I could not re&#383;olutely
de&#383;olate the &#383;cene my fancy flew to,
when worldly cares, when a knowledge
of mankind, which my circum&#383;tances
forced on me, rendered every other
in&#383;ipid. I was afraid of the unmarked
vacuity of common life; yet, though I
&#383;upinely indulged my&#383;elf in fairy-land,
when I ought to have been more actively
employed, virtue was &#383;till the
fir&#383;t mover of my actions; &#383;he dre&#383;&#383;ed
my love in &#383;uch enchanting colours,
and &#383;pread the net I could never break.
Our corre&#383;ponding feelings confounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-143_S" id="DPg_4-143_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-143.png">143</a>]</span>
our very &#383;ouls; and in many conver&#383;ations
we almo&#383;t intuitively di&#383;cerned
each other's &#383;entiments; the heart opened
it&#383;elf, not chilled by re&#383;erve, nor
afraid of mi&#383;con&#383;truction. But, if virtue
in&#383;pired love, love gave new energy to
virtue, and ab&#383;orbed every &#383;elfi&#383;h pa&#383;&#383;ion.
Never did even a wi&#383;h e&#383;cape
me, that my lover &#383;hould not fulfil the
hard duties which fate had impo&#383;ed on
him. I only di&#383;&#383;embled with him in
one particular; I endeavoured to &#383;often
his wife's too con&#383;picuous follies, and
extenuated her failings in an indirect
manner. To this I was prompted by a
loftine&#383;s of &#383;pirit; I &#383;hould have broken
the band of life, had I cea&#383;ed to re&#383;pect
my&#383;elf. But I will ha&#383;ten to an important
change in my circum&#383;tances.</p>

<p>My mother, who had concealed the
real &#383;tate of her affairs from me, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-144_S" id="DPg_4-144_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-144.png">144</a>]</span>
now impelled to make me her confident,
that I might a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t to di&#383;charge
her mighty debt of gratitude. The
merchant, my more than father, had
privately a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ted her: but a fatal civil-war
reduced his large property to a
bare competency; and an inflammation
in his eyes, that aro&#383;e from a cold he
had caught at a wreck, which he watched
during a &#383;tormy night to keep off
the lawle&#383;s colliers, almo&#383;t deprived
him of &#383;ight. His life had been &#383;pent
in &#383;ociety, and he &#383;carcely knew how
to fill the void; for his &#383;pirit would not
allow him to mix with his former
equals as an humble companion; he
who had been treated with uncommon
re&#383;pect, could not brook their in&#383;ulting
pity. From the re&#383;ource of &#383;olitude,
reading, the complaint in his eyes cut<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-145_S" id="DPg_4-145_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-145.png">145</a>]</span>
him off, and he became our con&#383;tant
vi&#383;itor.</p>

<p>Actuated by the &#383;incere&#383;t affection,
I u&#383;ed to read to him, and he mi&#383;took
my tenderne&#383;s for love. How could I
undeceive him, when every circum&#383;tance
frowned on him! Too &#383;oon I
found that I was his only comfort; I,
who rejected his hand when fortune
&#383;miled, could not now &#383;econd her blow;
and, in a moment of enthu&#383;ia&#383;tic gratitude
and tender compa&#383;&#383;ion, I offered
him my hand.&mdash;It was received with
plea&#383;ure; tran&#383;port was not made for
his &#383;oul; nor did he di&#383;cover that nature
had &#383;eparated us, by making me
alive to &#383;uch different &#383;en&#383;ations. My
mother was to live with us, and I
dwelt on this circum&#383;tance to bani&#383;h
cruel recollections, when the bent bow
returned to its former &#383;tate.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-146_S" id="DPg_4-146_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-146.png">146</a>]</span>
With a bur&#383;ting heart and a firm
voice, I named the day when I was to
&#383;eal my promi&#383;e. It came, in &#383;pite of
my regret; I had been previou&#383;ly preparing
my&#383;elf for the awful ceremony,
and an&#383;wered the &#383;olemn que&#383;tion with
a re&#383;olute tone, that would &#383;ilence the
dictates of my heart; it was a forced,
unvaried one; had nature modulated
it, my &#383;ecret would have e&#383;caped. My
active &#383;pirit was painfully on the watch
to repre&#383;s every tender emotion. The
joy in my venerable parent's countenance,
the tenderne&#383;s of my hu&#383;band,
as he conducted me home, for I really
had a &#383;incere affection for him, the gratulations
of my mind, when I thought
that this &#383;acrifice was heroic, all tended
to deceive me; but the joy of victory
over the re&#383;igned, pallid look of my
lover, haunted my imagination, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-147_S" id="DPg_4-147_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-147.png">147</a>]</span>
fixed it&#383;elf in the centre of my brain.&mdash;Still
I imagined, that his &#383;pirit was near
me, that he only felt &#383;orrow for my
lo&#383;s, and without complaint re&#383;igned
me to my duty.</p>

<p>I was left alone a moment; my two
elbows re&#383;ted on a table to &#383;upport my
chin. Ten thou&#383;and thoughts darted
with a&#383;toni&#383;hing velocity through my
mind. My eyes were dry; I was on the
brink of madne&#383;s. At this moment a
&#383;trange a&#383;&#383;ociation was made by my
imagination; I thought of Gallileo, who
when he left the inqui&#383;ition, looked
upwards, and cried out, "Yet it moves."
A &#383;hower of tears, like the refre&#383;hing
drops of heaven, relieved my parched
&#383;ockets; they fell di&#383;regarded on the
table; and, &#383;tamping with my foot, in an
agony I exclaimed, "Yet I love." My
hu&#383;band entered before I had calmed<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-148_S" id="DPg_4-148_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-148.png">148</a>]</span>
the&#383;e tumultuous emotions, and tenderly
took my hand. I &#383;natched it from
him; grief and &#383;urpri&#383;e were marked
on his countenance; I ha&#383;tily &#383;tretched
it out again. My heart &#383;mote me, and I
removed the tran&#383;ient mi&#383;t by an unfeigned
endeavour to plea&#383;e him.</p>

<p>A few months after, my mind grew
calmer; and, if a treacherous imagination,
if feelings many accidents revived,
&#383;ometimes plunged me into melancholy,
I often repeated with &#383;teady
conviction, that virtue was not an
empty name, and that, in following the
dictates of duty, I had not bidden adieu
to content.</p>

<p>In the cour&#383;e of a few years, the
dear object of my fonde&#383;t affection,
&#383;aid farewel, in dying accents. Thus
left alone, my grief became dear; and I
did not feel &#383;olitary, becau&#383;e I thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-149_S" id="DPg_4-149_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-149.png">149</a>]</span>
I might, without a crime, indulge a
pa&#383;&#383;ion, that grew more ardent than ever
when my imagination only pre&#383;ented
him to my view, and re&#383;tored my former
activity of &#383;oul which the late
calm had rendered torpid. I &#383;eemed to
find my&#383;elf again, to find the eccentric
warmth that gave me identity of character.
Rea&#383;on had governed my conduct,
but could not change my nature;
this voluptuous &#383;orrow was &#383;uperior to
every gratification of &#383;en&#383;e, and death
more firmly united our hearts.</p>

<p>Alive to every human affection, I
&#383;moothed my mothers pa&#383;&#383;age to eternity,
and &#383;o often gave my hu&#383;band
&#383;incere proofs of affection, he never
&#383;uppo&#383;ed that I was actuated by a more
fervent attachment. My melancholy,
my uneven &#383;pirits, he attributed to my
extreme &#383;en&#383;ibility, and loved me the<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-150_S" id="DPg_4-150_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-150.png">150</a>]</span>
better for po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ing qualities he could
not comprehend.</p>

<p>At the clo&#383;e of a &#383;ummer's day, &#383;ome
years after, I wandered with carele&#383;s
&#383;teps over a pathle&#383;s common; various
anxieties had rendered the hours which
the &#383;un had enlightened heavy; &#383;ober
evening came on; I wi&#383;hed to &#383;till "my
mind, and woo lone quiet in her &#383;ilent
walk." The &#383;cene accorded with my
feelings; it was wild and grand; and
the &#383;preading twilight had almo&#383;t confounded
the di&#383;tant &#383;ea with the barren,
blue hills that melted from my &#383;ight.
I &#383;at down on a ri&#383;ing ground; the rays
of the departing &#383;un illumined the horizon,
but &#383;o indi&#383;tinctly, that I anticipated
their total extinction. The
death of Nature led me to a &#383;till more
intere&#383;ting &#383;ubject, that came home to
my bo&#383;om, the death of him I loved.<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-151_S" id="DPg_4-151_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-151.png">151</a>]</span>
A village-bell was tolling; I li&#383;tened,
and thought of the moment when I
heard his interrupted breath, and felt
the agonizing fear, that the &#383;ame &#383;ound
would never more reach my ears, and
that the intelligence glanced from my
eyes, would no more be felt. The
&#383;poiler had &#383;eized his prey; the &#383;un
was fled, what was this world to me!
I wandered to another, where death
and darkne&#383;s could not enter; I pur&#383;ued
the &#383;un beyond the mountains,
and the &#383;oul e&#383;caped from this vale of
tears. My reflections were tinged with
melancholy, but they were &#383;ublime.&mdash;I
gra&#383;ped a mighty whole, and &#383;miled
on the king of terrors; the tie which
bound me to my friends he could not
break; the &#383;ame my&#383;terious knot united
me to the &#383;ource of all goodne&#383;s and
happine&#383;s. I had &#383;een the divinity re<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-152_S" id="DPg_4-152_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-152.png">152</a>]</span>flected
in a face I loved; I had read
immortal characters di&#383;played on a
human countenance, and forgot my&#383;elf
whil&#383;t I gazed. I could not think of
immortality, without recollecting the
ec&#383;tacy I felt, when my heart fir&#383;t whi&#383;pered
to me that I was beloved; and
again did I feel the &#383;acred tie of mutual
affection; fervently I prayed to the father
of mercies; and rejoiced that he
could &#383;ee every turn of a heart, who&#383;e
movements I could not perfectly under&#383;tand.
My pa&#383;&#383;ion &#383;eemed a pledge
of immortality; I did not wi&#383;h to hide
it from the all-&#383;earching eye of heaven.
Where indeed could I go from his pre&#383;ence?
and, whil&#383;t it was dear to me,
though darkne&#383;s might reign during
the night of life, joy would come when
I awoke to life everla&#383;ting.</p>

<p>I now turned my &#383;tep towards home,<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-153_S" id="DPg_4-153_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-153.png">153</a>]</span>
when the appearance of a girl, who
&#383;tood weeping on the common, attracted
my attention. I acco&#383;ted her,
and &#383;oon heard her &#383;imple tale; that her
father was gone to &#383;ea, and her mother
&#383;ick in bed. I followed her to their
little dwelling, and relieved the &#383;ick
wretch. I then again &#383;ought my own
abode; but death did not now haunt
my fancy. Contriving to give the poor
creature I had left more effectual relief,
I reached my own garden-gate very
weary, and re&#383;ted on it.&mdash;Recollecting
the turns of my mind during the walk,
I exclaimed, Surely life may thus be
enlivened by active benevolence, and
the &#383;leep of death, like that I am now
di&#383;po&#383;ed to fall into, may be &#383;weet!</p>

<p>My life was now unmarked by any
extraordinary change, and a few days<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-154_S" id="DPg_4-154_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-154.png">154</a>]</span>
ago I entered this cavern; for through
it every mortal mu&#383;t pa&#383;s; and here I
have di&#383;covered, that I neglected many
opportunities of being u&#383;eful, whil&#383;t I
fo&#383;tered a devouring flame. Remor&#383;e
has not reached me, becau&#383;e I firmly
adhered to my principles, and I have
al&#383;o di&#383;covered that I &#383;aw through a
fal&#383;e medium. Worthy as the mortal
was I adored, I &#383;hould not long have
loved him with the ardour I did, had
fate united us, and broken the delu&#383;ion
the imagination &#383;o artfully wove. His
virtues, as they now do, would have
extorted my e&#383;teem; but he who formed
the human &#383;oul, only can fill it, and the
chief happine&#383;s of an immortal being
mu&#383;t ari&#383;e from the &#383;ame &#383;ource as its
exi&#383;tence. Earthly love leads to heavenly,
and prepares us for a more ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-155_S" id="DPg_4-155_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-155.png">155</a>]</span>alted
&#383;tate; if it does not change its
nature, and de&#383;troy it&#383;elf, by trampling
on the virtue, that con&#383;titutes its e&#383;&#383;ence,
and allies us to the Deity.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p><span class="smcap">A ta&#383;te</span> for rural &#383;cenes, in the
pre&#383;ent &#383;tate of &#383;ociety, appears to be
very often an artificial &#383;entiment, rather
in&#383;pired by poetry and romances,
than a real perception of the beauties
of nature. But, as it is reckoned a
proof of refined ta&#383;te to prai&#383;e the calm
plea&#383;ures which the country affords, the
theme is never exhau&#383;ted. Yet it may
be made a que&#383;tion, whether this ro<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-160_S" id="DPg_4-160_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-160.png">160</a>]</span>mantic
kind of declamation, has much
effect on the conduct of tho&#383;e, who
leave, for a &#383;ea&#383;on, the crowded cities
in which they were bred.</p>

<p>I have been led to the&#383;e reflections,
by ob&#383;erving, when I have re&#383;ided for
any length of time in the country, how
few people &#383;eem to contemplate nature
with their own eyes. I have "bru&#383;hed
the dew away" in the morning; but,
pacing over the printle&#383;s gra&#383;s, I have
wondered that, in &#383;uch delightful &#383;ituations,
the &#383;un was allowed to ri&#383;e in
&#383;olitary maje&#383;ty, whil&#383;t my eyes alone
hailed its beautifying beams. The
webs of the evening have &#383;till been
&#383;pread acro&#383;s the hedged path, unle&#383;s
&#383;ome labouring man, trudging to work,
di&#383;turbed the fairy &#383;tructure; yet, in
&#383;pite of this &#383;upinene&#383;s, when I joined<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-161_S" id="DPg_4-161_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-161.png">161</a>]</span>
the &#383;ocial circle, every tongue rang
changes on the plea&#383;ures of the country.</p>

<p>Having frequently had occa&#383;ion to
make the &#383;ame ob&#383;ervation, I was led to
endeavour, in one of my &#383;olitary rambles,
to trace the cau&#383;e, and likewi&#383;e
to enquire why the poetry written in
the infancy of &#383;ociety, is mo&#383;t natural:
which, &#383;trictly &#383;peaking (for <i>natural</i>
is a very indefinite expre&#383;&#383;ion) is merely
to &#383;ay, that it is the tran&#383;cript of immediate
&#383;en&#383;ations, in all their native
wildne&#383;s and &#383;implicity, when fancy,
awakened by the &#383;ight of intere&#383;ting
objects, was mo&#383;t actively at work.
At &#383;uch moments, &#383;en&#383;ibility quickly
furni&#383;hes &#383;imiles, and the &#383;ublimated
&#383;pirits combine images, which ri&#383;ing
&#383;pontaneou&#383;ly, it is not nece&#383;&#383;ary coldly
to ran&#383;ack the under&#383;tanding or memory,
till the laborious efforts of judg<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-162_S" id="DPg_4-162_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-162.png">162</a>]</span>ment
exclude pre&#383;ent &#383;en&#383;ations, and
damp the fire of enthu&#383;ia&#383;m.</p>

<p>The effu&#383;ions of a vigorous mind, will
ever tell us how far the under&#383;tanding
has been enlarged by thought, and
&#383;tored with knowledge. The richne&#383;s
of the &#383;oil even appears on the &#383;urface;
and the re&#383;ult of profound thinking,
often mixing, with playful grace, in the
reveries of the poet, &#383;moothly incorporates
with the ebullitions of animal
&#383;pirits, when the finely fa&#383;hioned nerve
vibrates acutely with rapture, or when,
relaxed by &#383;oft melancholy, a plea&#383;ing
languor prompts the long-drawn &#383;igh,
and feeds the &#383;lowly falling tear.</p>

<p>The poet, the man of &#383;trong feelings,
gives us only an image of his mind,
when he was actually alone, conver&#383;ing
with him&#383;elf, and marking the impre&#383;&#383;ion
which nature had made on his<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-163_S" id="DPg_4-163_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-163.png">163</a>]</span>
own heart.&mdash;If, at this &#383;acred moment,
the idea of &#383;ome departed friend, &#383;ome
tender recollection when the &#383;oul was
mo&#383;t alive to tenderne&#383;s, intruded unawares
into his thoughts, the &#383;orrow
which it produced is artle&#383;&#383;ly, yet poetically
expre&#383;&#383;ed&mdash;and who can avoid
&#383;ympathizing?</p>

<p>Love to man leads to devotion&mdash;grand
and &#383;ublime images &#383;trike the
imagination&mdash;God is &#383;een in every
floating cloud, and comes from the
mi&#383;ty mountain to receive the noble&#383;t
homage of an intelligent creature&mdash;prai&#383;e.
How &#383;olemn is the moment,
when all affections and remembrances
fade before the &#383;ublime admiration
which the wi&#383;dom and goodne&#383;s of God
in&#383;pires, when he is wor&#383;hipped in a
<i>temple not made with hands</i>, and the
world &#383;eems to contain only the mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-164_S" id="DPg_4-164_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-164.png">164</a>]</span>
that formed, and the mind that contemplates
it! The&#383;e are not the weak
re&#383;pon&#383;es of ceremonial devotion; nor,
to expre&#383;s them, would the poet need
another poet's aid: his heart burns
within him, and he &#383;peaks the language
of truth and nature with re&#383;i&#383;tle&#383;s
energy.</p>

<p>Inequalities, of cour&#383;e, are ob&#383;ervable
in his effu&#383;ions; and a le&#383;s vigorous
fancy, with more ta&#383;te, would
have produced more elegance and uniformity;
but, as pa&#383;&#383;ages are &#383;oftened
or expunged during the cooler moments
of reflection, the under&#383;tanding
is gratified at the expence of tho&#383;e involuntary
&#383;en&#383;ations, which, like the
beauteous tints of an evening &#383;ky, are
&#383;o evane&#383;cent, that they melt into new
forms before they can be analyzed. For
however eloquently we may boa&#383;t of<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-165_S" id="DPg_4-165_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-165.png">165</a>]</span>
our rea&#383;on, man mu&#383;t often be delighted
he cannot tell why, or his blunt
feelings are not made to reli&#383;h the beauties
which nature, poetry, or any of
the imitative arts, afford.</p>

<p>The imagery of the ancients &#383;eems
naturally to have been borrowed from
&#383;urrounding objects and their mythology.
When a hero is to be tran&#383;ported
from one place to another, acro&#383;s
pathle&#383;s wa&#383;tes, is any vehicle &#383;o natural,
as one of the fleecy clouds on which
the poet has often gazed, &#383;carcely con&#383;cious
that he wi&#383;hed to make it his
chariot? Again, when nature &#383;eems
to pre&#383;ent ob&#383;tacles to his progre&#383;s at
almo&#383;t every &#383;tep, when the tangled
fore&#383;t and &#383;teep mountain &#383;tand as barriers,
to pa&#383;s over which the mind
longs for &#383;upernatural aid; an interpo&#383;ing
deity, who walks on the waves,<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-166_S" id="DPg_4-166_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-166.png">166</a>]</span>
and rules the &#383;torm, &#383;everely felt in the
fir&#383;t attempts to cultivate a country,
will receive from the impa&#383;&#383;ioned fancy
"a local habitation and a name."</p>

<p>It would be a philo&#383;ophical enquiry,
and throw &#383;ome light on the hi&#383;tory of
the human mind, to trace, as far as our
information will allow us to trace, the
&#383;pontaneous feelings and ideas which
have produced the images that now
frequently appear unnatural, becau&#383;e
they are remote; and di&#383;gu&#383;ting, becau&#383;e
they have been &#383;ervilely copied
by poets, who&#383;e habits of thinking,
and views of nature mu&#383;t have been
different; for, though the under&#383;tanding
&#383;eldom di&#383;turbs the current of our pre&#383;ent
feelings, without di&#383;&#383;ipating the
gay clouds which fancy has been embracing,
yet it &#383;ilently gives the colour
to the whole tenour of them, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-167_S" id="DPg_4-167_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-167.png">167</a>]</span>
dream is over, when truth is gro&#383;&#383;ly
violated, or images introduced, &#383;elected
from books, and not from local manners
or popular prejudices.</p>

<p>In a more advanced &#383;tate of civilization,
a poet is rather the creature of
art, than of nature. The books that he
reads in his youth, become a hot-bed
in which artificial fruits are produced,
beautiful to the common eye, though
they want the true hue and flavour.
His images do not ari&#383;e from &#383;en&#383;ations;
they are copies; and, like the works
of the painters who copy ancient &#383;tatues
when they draw men and women
of their own times, we acknowledge
that the features are fine, and the proportions
ju&#383;t; yet they are men of
&#383;tone; in&#383;ipid figures, that never convey
to the mind the idea of a portrait
taken from life, where the &#383;oul gives<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-168_S" id="DPg_4-168_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-168.png">168</a>]</span>
&#383;pirit and homogeneity to the whole.
The &#383;ilken wings of fancy are &#383;hrivelled
by rules; and a de&#383;ire of attaining
elegance of diction, occa&#383;ions an attention
to words, incompatible with
&#383;ublime, impa&#383;&#383;ioned thoughts.</p>

<p>A boy of abilities, who has been
taught the &#383;tructure of ver&#383;e at &#383;chool,
and been rou&#383;ed by emulation to compo&#383;e
rhymes whil&#383;t he was reading
works of genius, may, by practice,
produce pretty ver&#383;es, and even become
what is often termed an elegant
poet: yet his readers, without knowing
what to find fault with, do not
find them&#383;elves warmly intere&#383;ted. In
the works of the poets who fa&#383;ten on
their affections, they &#383;ee gro&#383;&#383;er faults,
and the very images which &#383;hock their
ta&#383;te in the modern; &#383;till they do not appear
as puerile or extrin&#383;ic in one as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-169_S" id="DPg_4-169_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-169.png">169</a>]</span>
other.&mdash;Why?&mdash;becau&#383;e they did not
appear &#383;o to the author.</p>

<p>It may &#383;ound paradoxical, after ob&#383;erving
that tho&#383;e productions want
vigour, that are merely the work of
imitation, in which the under&#383;tanding
has violently directed, if not extingui&#383;hed,
the blaze of fancy, to a&#383;&#383;ert, that,
though genius be only another word
for exqui&#383;ite &#383;en&#383;ibility, the fir&#383;t ob&#383;ervers
of nature, the true poets, exerci&#383;ed
their under&#383;tanding much more
than their imitators. But they exerci&#383;ed
it to di&#383;criminate things, whil&#383;t
their followers were bu&#383;y to borrow
&#383;entiments and arrange words.</p>

<p>Boys who have received a cla&#383;&#383;ical
education, load their memory with
words, and the corre&#383;pondent ideas
are perhaps never di&#383;tinctly comprehended.
As a proof of this a&#383;&#383;ertion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-170_S" id="DPg_4-170_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-170.png">170</a>]</span>
I mu&#383;t ob&#383;erve, that I have known
many young people who could write
tolerably &#383;mooth ver&#383;es, and &#383;tring epithets
prettily together, when their
pro&#383;e themes &#383;howed the barrenne&#383;s of
their minds, and how &#383;uperficial the
cultivation mu&#383;t have been, which
their under&#383;tanding had received.</p>

<p>Dr. John&#383;on, I know, has given a definition
of genius, which would overturn
my rea&#383;oning, if I were to admit
it.&mdash;He imagines, that <i>a &#383;trong mind,
accidentally led to &#383;ome particular &#383;tudy</i> in
which it excels, is a genius.&mdash;Not to
&#383;top to inve&#383;tigate the cau&#383;es which
produced this happy <i>&#383;trength</i> of mind,
experience &#383;eems to prove, that tho&#383;e
minds have appeared mo&#383;t vigorous,
that have pur&#383;ued a &#383;tudy, after nature
had di&#383;covered a bent; for it would be
ab&#383;urd to &#383;uppo&#383;e, that a &#383;light impre&#383;<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-171_S" id="DPg_4-171_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-171.png">171</a>]</span>&#383;ion
made on the weak faculties of a
boy, is the fiat of fate, and not to be
effaced by any &#383;ucceeding impre&#383;&#383;ion,
or unexpected difficulty. Dr. John&#383;on
in fact, appears &#383;ometimes to be of the
&#383;ame opinion (how con&#383;i&#383;tently I &#383;hall
not now enquire), e&#383;pecially when he
ob&#383;erves, "that Thom&#383;on looked on
nature with the eye which &#383;he only
gives to a poet."</p>

<p>But, though it &#383;hould be allowed
that books may produce &#383;ome poets, I
fear they will never be the poets who
charm our cares to &#383;leep, or extort admiration.
They may diffu&#383;e ta&#383;te, and
poli&#383;h the language; but I am inclined
to conclude that they will &#383;eldom rou&#383;e
the pa&#383;&#383;ions, or amend the heart.</p>

<p>And, to return to the fir&#383;t &#383;ubject of
di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ion, the rea&#383;on why mo&#383;t people
are more intere&#383;ted by a &#383;cene de&#383;crib<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-172_S" id="DPg_4-172_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-172.png">172</a>]</span>ed
by a poet, than by a view of nature,
probably ari&#383;es from the want of a
lively imagination. The poet contracts
the pro&#383;pect, and, &#383;electing the mo&#383;t
picture&#383;que part in his <i>camera</i>, the judgment
is directed, and the whole force
of the languid faculty turned towards
the objects which excited the mo&#383;t
forcible emotions in the poet's heart;
the reader con&#383;equently feels the enlivened
de&#383;cription, though he was not
able to receive a fir&#383;t impre&#383;&#383;ion from
the operations of his own mind.</p>

<p>Be&#383;ides, it may be further ob&#383;erved,
that gro&#383;s minds are only to be moved
by forcible repre&#383;entations. To rou&#383;e
the thoughtle&#383;s, objects mu&#383;t be pre&#383;ented,
calculated to produce tumultuous
emotions; the un&#383;ub&#383;tantial, picture&#383;que
forms which a contemplative
man gazes on, and often follows with<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-173_S" id="DPg_4-173_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-173.png">173</a>]</span>
ardour till he is mocked by a glimp&#383;e
of unattainable excellence, appear to
them the light vapours of a dreaming
enthu&#383;ia&#383;t, who gives up the &#383;ub&#383;tance
for the &#383;hadow. It is not within that
they &#383;eek amu&#383;ement; their eyes are
&#383;eldom turned on them&#383;elves; con&#383;equently
their emotions, though &#383;ometimes
fervid, are always tran&#383;ient, and
the nicer perceptions which di&#383;tingui&#383;h
the man of genuine ta&#383;te, are not felt,
or make &#383;uch a &#383;light impre&#383;&#383;ion as
&#383;carcely to excite any plea&#383;urable &#383;en&#383;ations.
Is it &#383;urpri&#383;ing then that they
are often overlooked, even by tho&#383;e
who are delighted by the &#383;ame images
concentrated by the poet?</p>

<p>But even this numerous cla&#383;s is exceeded,
by witlings, who, anxious
to appear to have wit and ta&#383;te, do
not allow their under&#383;tandings or feel<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-174_S" id="DPg_4-174_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-174.png">174</a>]</span>ings
any liberty; for, in&#383;tead of cultivating
their faculties and reflecting on
their operations, they are bu&#383;y collecting
prejudices; and are predetermined
to admire what the &#383;uffrage of time
announces as excellent, not to &#383;tore up
a fund of amu&#383;ement for them&#383;elves,
but to enable them to talk.</p>

<p>The&#383;e hints will a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t the reader to
trace &#383;ome of the cau&#383;es why the beauties
of nature are not forcibly felt,
when civilization, or rather luxury,
has made con&#383;iderable advances&mdash;tho&#383;e
calm &#383;en&#383;ations are not &#383;ufficiently
lively to &#383;erve as a relaxation to the voluptuary,
or even to the moderate pur&#383;uer
of artificial plea&#383;ures. In the pre&#383;ent
&#383;tate of &#383;ociety, the under&#383;tanding
mu&#383;t bring back the feelings to nature,
or the &#383;en&#383;ibility mu&#383;t have &#383;uch native
&#383;trength, as rather to be whetted than<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-175_S" id="DPg_4-175_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-175.png">175</a>]</span>
de&#383;troyed by the &#383;trong exerci&#383;es of
pa&#383;&#383;ion.</p>

<p>That the mo&#383;t valuable things are liable
to the greate&#383;t perver&#383;ion, is however
as trite as true:&mdash;for the &#383;ame &#383;en&#383;ibility,
or quickne&#383;s of &#383;en&#383;es, which
makes a man reli&#383;h the tranquil &#383;cenes
of nature, when &#383;en&#383;ation, rather than
rea&#383;on, imparts delight, frequently makes
a libertine of him, by leading him to
prefer the &#383;en&#383;ual tumult of love a
little refined by &#383;entiment, to the calm
plea&#383;ures of affectionate friend&#383;hip, in
who&#383;e &#383;ober &#383;ati&#383;factions, rea&#383;on, mixing
her tranquillizing convictions, whi&#383;pers,
that content, not happine&#383;s, is the
reward of virtue in this world.</p>

<p>It is generally &#383;uppo&#383;ed, that the
imagination of women is particularly<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-180_S" id="DPg_4-180_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-180.png">180</a>]</span>
active, and leads them a&#383;tray. Why
then do we &#383;eek by education only to
exerci&#383;e their imagination and feeling,
till the under&#383;tanding, grown rigid by
di&#383;u&#383;e, is unable to exerci&#383;e it&#383;elf&mdash;and
the &#383;uperfluous nouri&#383;hment the
imagination and feeling have received,
renders the former romantic, and the
latter weak?</p>

<p class="center">4.</p>
<p>Few men have ri&#383;en to any great
eminence in learning, who have not
received &#383;omething like a regular education.
Why are women expected to
&#383;urmount difficulties that men are not
equal to?</p>

<p class="center">5.</p>
<p>Nothing can be more ab&#383;urd than
the ridicule of the critic, that the heroine
of his mock-tragedy was in love
with the very man whom &#383;he ought<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-181_S" id="DPg_4-181_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-181.png">181</a>]</span>
lea&#383;t to have loved; he could not have
given a better rea&#383;on. How can pa&#383;&#383;ion
gain &#383;trength any other way? In Otaheite,
love cannot be known, where
the ob&#383;tacles to irritate an indi&#383;criminate
appetite, and &#383;ublimate the &#383;imple
&#383;en&#383;ations of de&#383;ire till they mount to
pa&#383;&#383;ion, are never known. There a
man or woman cannot love the very
per&#383;on they ought not to have loved&mdash;nor
does jealou&#383;y ever fan the flame.</p>

<p class="center">6.</p>
<p>It has frequently been ob&#383;erved, that,
when women have an object in view,
they pur&#383;ue it with more &#383;teadine&#383;s than
men, particularly love. This is not
a compliment. Pa&#383;&#383;ion pur&#383;ues with
more heat than rea&#383;on, and with mo&#383;t
ardour during the ab&#383;ence of rea&#383;on.</p>

<p class="center">7.</p>
<p>Men are more &#383;ubject to the phy&#383;ical<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-182_S" id="DPg_4-182_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-182.png">182</a>]</span>
love than women. The confined education
of women makes them more
&#383;ubject to jealou&#383;y.</p>

<p class="center">8.</p>
<p>Simplicity &#383;eems, in general, the con&#383;equence
of ignorance, as I have ob&#383;erved
in the characters of women and
&#383;ailors&mdash;the being confined to one track
of impre&#383;&#383;ions.</p>

<p class="center">9.</p>
<p>I know of no other way of pre&#383;erving
the cha&#383;tity of mankind, than that
of rendering women rather objects of
love than de&#383;ire. The difference is
great. Yet, while women are encouraged
to ornament their per&#383;ons at the
expence of their minds, while indolence
renders them helple&#383;s and la&#383;civious
(for what other name can be
given to the common intercour&#383;e between
the &#383;exes?) they will be, gene<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-183_S" id="DPg_4-183_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-183.png">183</a>]</span>rally
&#383;peaking, only objects of de&#383;ire;
and, to &#383;uch women, men cannot be
con&#383;tant. Men, accu&#383;tomed only to
have their &#383;en&#383;es moved, merely &#383;eek
for a &#383;elfi&#383;h gratification in the &#383;ociety
of women, and their &#383;exual in&#383;tinct,
being neither &#383;upported by the under&#383;tanding
nor the heart, mu&#383;t be excited
by variety.</p>

<p class="center">10.</p>
<p>We ought to re&#383;pect old opinions;
though prejudices, blindly adopted,
lead to error, and preclude all exerci&#383;e

<p>The emulation which often makes a
boy mi&#383;chievous, is a generous &#383;pur;
and the old remark, that unlucky, turbulent
boys, make the wi&#383;e&#383;t and be&#383;t
men, is true, &#383;pite of Mr. Knox's arguments.
It has been ob&#383;erved, that the
mo&#383;t adventurous hor&#383;es, when tamed<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-184_S" id="DPg_4-184_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-184.png">184</a>]</span>

tractable.</p>

<p>The children who &#383;tart up &#383;uddenly
at twelve or fourteen, and fall into decays,
in con&#383;equence, as it is termed,
of outgrowing their &#383;trength, are in
general, I believe, tho&#383;e children, who
have been bred up with mi&#383;taken tenderne&#383;s,
and not allowed to &#383;port and
take exerci&#383;e in the open air. This is
analogous to plants: for it is found that
they run up &#383;ickly, long &#383;talks, when
confined.</p>

<p class="center">12.</p>
<p>Children &#383;hould be taught to feel deference,
not to practi&#383;e &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the fine arts, is &#383;eldom

<p class="center">17.</p>
<p>There does not appear to be any evil
in the world, but what is nece&#383;&#383;ary.
The doctrine of rewards and puni&#383;hments,
not con&#383;idered as a means of re<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-186_S" id="DPg_4-186_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-186.png">186</a>]</span>formation,
appears to me an infamous
libel on divine goodne&#383;s.</p>

<p class="center">18.</p>
<p>Whether virtue is founded on rea&#383;on
or revelation, virtue is wi&#383;dom, and
vice is folly. Why are po&#383;itive puni&#383;hments?</p>

<p class="center">19.</p>
<p>Few can walk alone. The &#383;taff of
Chri&#383;tianity is the nece&#383;&#383;ary &#383;upport of
human weakne&#383;s. But an acquaintance
with the nature of man and virtue,
with ju&#383;t &#383;entiments on the attributes,
would be &#383;ufficient, without a voice
from heaven, to lead &#383;ome to virtue,
but not the mob.</p>

<p class="center">20.</p>
<p>I only expect the natural reward of
virtue, whatever it may be. I rely not
on a po&#383;itive reward.</p>

<p>The ju&#383;tice of God can be vindicated<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-187_S" id="DPg_4-187_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-187.png">187</a>]</span>
by a belief in a future &#383;tate&mdash;but a continuation
of being vindicates it as
clearly, as the po&#383;itive &#383;y&#383;tem of rewards
and puni&#383;hments&mdash;by evil educing
good for the individual, and not
for an imaginary whole. The happine&#383;s
of the whole mu&#383;t ari&#383;e from the
happine&#383;s of the con&#383;tituent parts, or
this world is not a &#383;tate of trial, but a
&#383;chool.</p>

<p class="center">21.</p>
<p>The vices acquired by Augu&#383;tus to
retain his power, mu&#383;t have tainted his
&#383;oul, and prevented that increa&#383;e of
happine&#383;s a good man expects in the
next &#383;tage of exi&#383;tence. This was a
natural puni&#383;hment.</p>

<p class="center">22.</p>
<p>The lover is ever mo&#383;t deeply enamoured,
when it is with he knows
not what&mdash;and the devotion of a my&#383;tic<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-188_S" id="DPg_4-188_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-188.png">188</a>]</span>
has a rude Gothic grandeur in it, which
the re&#383;pectful adoration of a philo&#383;opher
will never reach. I may be
thought fanciful; but it has continually
occurred to me, that, though, I allow,
rea&#383;on in this world is the mother
of wi&#383;dom&mdash;yet &#383;ome flights of the imagination
&#383;eem to reach what wi&#383;dom
cannot teach&mdash;and, while they delude
us here, afford a glorious hope, if not
a foreta&#383;te, of what we may expect
hereafter. He that created us, did not
mean to mark us with ideal images of
grandeur, the <i>ba&#383;ele&#383;s fabric of a vi&#383;ion</i>&mdash;No&mdash;that
perfection we follow with
hopele&#383;s ardour when the whi&#383;perings
of rea&#383;on are heard, may be found,
when not incompatible with our &#383;tate,
in the round of eternity. Perfection
indeed mu&#383;t, even then, be a comparative
idea&mdash;but the wi&#383;dom, the hap<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-189_S" id="DPg_4-189_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-189.png">189</a>]</span>pine&#383;s
of a &#383;uperior &#383;tate, has been &#383;uppo&#383;ed
to be intuitive, and the happie&#383;t
effu&#383;ions of human genius have &#383;eemed
like in&#383;piration&mdash;the deductions of rea&#383;on
de&#383;troy &#383;ublimity.</p>

<p class="center">23.</p>
<p>I am more and more convinced, that
poetry is the fir&#383;t efferve&#383;cence of the
imagination, and the forerunner of civilization.</p>

<p class="center">24.</p>
<p>When the Arabs had no trace of literature
or &#383;cience, they compo&#383;ed
beautiful ver&#383;es on the &#383;ubjects of love

and the laboured deductions of
rea&#383;on, appear almo&#383;t incompatible.</p>

<p class="center">25.</p>
<p>Poetry certainly flouri&#383;hes mo&#383;t in
the fir&#383;t rude &#383;tate of &#383;ociety. The

&#383;ublime expre&#383;&#383;ion, which has been &#383;o
often quoted, [Gene&#383;is, ch. 1, ver. 3.]
is perhaps a barbarous flight; or rather
the grand conception of an uncultivated
mind; for it is contrary to nature
and experience, to &#383;uppo&#383;e that this
account is founded on facts&mdash;It is
doubtle&#383;s a &#383;ublime allegory. But a
cultivated mind would not thus have
de&#383;cribed the creation&mdash;for, arguing
from analogy, it appears that creation
mu&#383;t have been a comprehen&#383;ive plan,
and that the Supreme Being always
u&#383;es &#383;econd cau&#383;es, &#383;lowly and &#383;ilently
to fulfil his purpo&#383;e. This is, in reality,
a more &#383;ublime view of that power
which wi&#383;dom &#383;upports: but it is not
the &#383;ublimity that would &#383;trike the impa&#383;&#383;ioned
mind, in which the imagination
took place of intellect. Tell a
being, who&#383;e affections and pa&#383;&#383;ions
have been more exerci&#383;ed than his rea<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-191_S" id="DPg_4-191_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-191.png">191</a>]</span>&#383;on,
that God &#383;aid, <i>Let there be light!
and there was light</i>; and he would pro&#383;trate
him&#383;elf before the Being who
could thus call things out of nothing,
as if they were: but a man in whom
rea&#383;on had taken place of pa&#383;&#383;ion,
would not adore, till wi&#383;dom was con&#383;picuous
as well as power, for his admiration
mu&#383;t be founded on principle.</p>

<p class="center">26.</p>
<p>Individuality is ever con&#383;picuous in
tho&#383;e enthu&#383;ia&#383;tic flights of fancy, in
which rea&#383;on is left behind, without
being lo&#383;t &#383;ight of.</p>

<p>The mind has been too often brought

<p>Mr. Kant has ob&#383;erved, that the under&#383;tanding
is &#383;ublime, the imagination

and men who undoubtedly po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s the
livelie&#383;t imagination, are mo&#383;t touched
by the &#383;ublime, while men who have
cold, enquiring minds, have not this

<p>The Grecian buildings are graceful&mdash;they

<p>When we &#383;ay that a per&#383;on is an
original, it is only to &#383;ay in other words
that he thinks. "The le&#383;s a man has
cultivated his rational faculties, the
more powerful is the principle of
imitation, over his actions, and his
habits of thinking. Mo&#383;t women,
of cour&#383;e, are more influenced by
the behaviour, the fa&#383;hions, and the
opinions of tho&#383;e with whom they
a&#383;&#383;ociate, than men." (Smellie.)</p>

<p>When we read a book which &#383;upports
our favourite opinions, how eagerly
do we &#383;uck in the doctrines, and
&#383;uffer our minds placidly to reflect the
images which illu&#383;trate the tenets we<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-194_S" id="DPg_4-194_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-194.png">194</a>]</span>
have embraced? We indolently or
quietly acquie&#383;ce in the conclu&#383;ion, and
our &#383;pirit animates and connects the
various &#383;ubjects. But, on the contrary,
when we peru&#383;e a &#383;kilful writer,
who does not coincide in opinion with
us, how is the mind on the watch to
detect fallacy? And this coolne&#383;s often
prevents our being carried away by a
&#383;tream of eloquence, which the prejudiced
mind terms declamation&mdash;a pomp
of words.&mdash;We never allow our&#383;elves to
be warmed; and, after contending
with the writer, are more confirmed
in our own opinion, as much perhaps
from a &#383;pirit of contradiction as from
rea&#383;on.&mdash;Such is the &#383;trength of man!</p>

<p>It is the individual manner of &#383;eeing
and feeling, pourtrayed by a &#383;trong
imagination in bold images that have<span class='pagenum'><a name="DPg_4-195_S" id="DPg_4-195_S"></a>[<a href="images/v4-195.png">195</a>]</span>
&#383;truck the &#383;en&#383;es, which creates all the
charms of poetry. A great reader is
always quoting the de&#383;cription of another's
emotions; a &#383;trong imagination
delights to paint its own. A writer of
genius makes us feel; an inferior author
rea&#383;on.</p>

<p>Some principle prior to &#383;elf-love mu&#383;t
have exi&#383;ted: the feeling which produced
the plea&#383;ure, mu&#383;t have exi&#383;ted
before the experience.</p>
